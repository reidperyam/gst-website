## Task: Fix Failing E2E Tests - Theme Toggle Navigation
**Date Started**: February 2, 2026
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

### Plan
- [x] Fix test variable name typo in theme-toggle.test.ts (line 92)
- [x] Add inline theme initialization script to BaseLayout.astro
- [x] Simplify ThemeToggle.astro by removing redundant initialization code
- [x] Run E2E tests to verify all fixes work
- [x] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions

### Implementation Notes

#### Fix 1: Test Variable Typo
**File**: `tests/e2e/theme-toggle.test.ts:92`
- Changed `initialWasDark` → `initialIsDark`
- Critical bug causing TypeError during test execution

#### Fix 2: Theme Initialization Timing
**File**: `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`
- Added `<script is:inline>` in head section
- Initializes theme synchronously BEFORE page render
- Prevents FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)
- Eliminates race conditions in E2E tests

#### Fix 3: Simplified ThemeToggle Component
**File**: `src/components/ThemeToggle.astro`
- Removed redundant initialization code (15 lines)
- Kept only the click handler for toggle functionality
- Theme initialization now centralized in BaseLayout

### Verification
- [x] E2E Tests: 33/33 passed (11 tests × 3 browsers)
- [x] Full Test Suite: 372/372 passed (100 unit/integration + 272 E2E)
- [x] Zero regressions - all existing tests pass
- [x] No breaking changes introduced

### Results
✅ **All 3 failing tests now pass**
- "should maintain theme across navigation" [chromium, firefox, webkit]

**Benefits Achieved:**
1. Fixes critical test failures
2. Eliminates FOUC - smoother user experience
3. Better architecture - proper separation of concerns
4. Code cleanup - removed redundant code
5. Zero regressions - full test suite passes

### Commits Created
Three discrete, logical commits were created:

1. **4f58ad0** - Fix test variable typo in theme toggle navigation test
   - File: `tests/e2e/theme-toggle.test.ts`
   - Change: Line 92, `initialWasDark` → `initialIsDark`
   - Impact: Fixes TypeError preventing test execution

2. **93c918e** - Add synchronous theme initialization to prevent FOUC and race conditions
   - File: `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`
   - Change: Added `<script is:inline>` in head section
   - Impact: Initializes theme before page render, prevents race conditions

3. **be3ea9d** - Simplify ThemeToggle component by removing redundant initialization

   - Change: Removed 15 lines of duplicate initialization code
   - Impact: Cleaner component, single source of truth for initialization

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Fix Failing E2E Tests - Theme Toggle Navigation (Completed Feb 2, 2026)

**Issue**: Three E2E tests failing across all browsers (chromium, firefox, webkit):
- "Theme Toggle Journey › should maintain theme across navigation"

**Root Causes**:
1. Critical bug in test code - undefined variable `initialWasDark`
2. Async theme initialization causing race condition and FOUC

**Solution**: Three targeted fixes
1. Fixed variable name typo in test
2. Added synchronous theme initialization to BaseLayout.astro
3. Removed redundant initialization code from ThemeToggle.astro

**Results**:
- ✅ 33/33 E2E tests passing (all 3 failing tests now pass)
- ✅ 372/372 total tests passing (zero regressions)
- ✅ Improved UX - eliminated FOUC
- ✅ Better architecture - proper separation of concerns
