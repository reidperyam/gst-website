# Learning Log: GST Website Project

This file captures patterns, mistakes, and learnings to improve future work on this project.

## Lessons Learned

### Lesson: PR scope must match actual new commits, not full branch divergence
**Date Identified**: 2026-02-18
**Severity**: Critical

#### Pattern
When creating a PR from `dev` to `master`, used `git log master..HEAD` and `git diff master...HEAD` which showed ALL 245 diverged commits instead of just the 1 new commit since the last merge PR.

#### Root Cause
`master` is far behind `dev` (many prior PRs already merged). Using `master..HEAD` shows the entire divergence history, not just what's new since the last PR. Did not check which commits were already covered by previous merged PRs.

#### Rule for Future
Before creating a PR, identify the last merge point (e.g., the most recent merge PR). Only include commits after that point. Use `git show <commit> --stat` on the specific new commit(s) to confirm scope. When the user says "create a PR," check if the branch has been incrementally merged before and scope accordingly.

#### Example
PR #34 was created with 245 commits and 89 files when only 1 commit (`fb6653a`) touching 1 file was new. Had to close #34 and create #35 with the correct scope.

### Lesson: Content changes must include E2E test updates for hardcoded strings
**Date Identified**: 2026-02-28
**Severity**: Critical

#### Pattern
Changed brand name from "Global Strategic Technologies" to "GST" across 10 source files but missed 2 E2E test assertions that expected the old string. Tests failed in CI across all 3 browsers.

#### Root Cause
Did not grep the test directory for old strings being replaced. Treated the change as "content only" and skipped checking test assertions that match on rendered text.

#### Rule for Future
After ANY content/copy change, immediately grep `tests/` for the old strings before committing. Run: `grep -r "OLD_STRING" tests/` for every string changed. This applies to brand names, headings, CTA text, meta descriptions — anything that might appear in a test assertion. Added as directive #8 in CLAUDE.md.

#### Example
Changed `Global Strategic Technologies` → `GST` in diligence machine source but missed `diligence-machine.test.ts:516` (`.doc-brand-name` assertion) and `:812` (clipboard content assertion). All 3 browser E2E tests failed.

## How to Add a Lesson

When a correction is made or improvement identified:

1. **Pattern**: What was the mistake or gap?
2. **Root Cause**: Why did it happen?
3. **Rule**: What rule prevents this in the future?
4. **Example**: Specific case that triggered this lesson
