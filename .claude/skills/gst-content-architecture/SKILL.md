## Brand Voice Guidelines

### Core Principles

**Authoritative Without Arrogance**
- State capabilities declaratively, don't oversell
- Let results speak through metrics
- Avoid superlatives ("best," "leading," "premier")
- Use specific language over vague claims

**Business-Focused Language**
- Lead with business outcomes, not technical features
- "Revenue growth" before "platform modernization"
- "Risk mitigation" before "security assessment"
- "EBITDA improvement" before "cost optimization"

**Executive Peer-to-Peer Tone**
- Collaborative framing ("Let's discuss" not "Let us show you")
- Assumes audience sophistication
- No condescension or over-explanation
- Respects time constraints

**Quantified and Specific**
- Use precise metrics: "Δ$8.2M EBITDA" not "significant improvement"
- Cite timeframes: "14-week implementation" not "rapid deployment"
- Reference scale: "127 microservices" not "complex architecture"
- Show transformation: Before/after states with Δ notation

### Voice Characteristics

**DO Use:**
- Active voice: "We deliver" not "Results are delivered"
- Present tense: "We assess" not "We will assess"
- Concrete nouns: "platform," "pipeline," "integration"
- Action verbs: "Execute," "Transform," "Accelerate," "De-risk"
- Delta notation: "Δ Revenue: +$12M"

**DON'T Use:**
- Marketing jargon: "synergy," "paradigm shift," "game-changing"
- Buzzwords: "AI-powered," "next-generation," "cutting-edge"
- Hedging: "might," "could potentially," "we believe"
- Excessive modifiers: "extremely," "very," "highly"
- Tech-for-tech's-sake: Avoid acronyms without business context

### Sentence Structure Patterns

**Headlines (H1):**
```
[Action/State] + [Business Outcome]
"Strategic Advisory & Execution"
"Technology Transformation for Portfolio Value"
"De-Risking High-Stakes Technology Investments"
```

**Subheadlines (H2):**
```
[Specific Capability] + [Target Audience Context]
"Technical diligence and value creation execution for private equity"
"Integration roadmaps that accelerate portfolio company performance"
"Risk frameworks built for billion-dollar technology transactions"
```

**Body Copy:**
```
[Problem Context] → [Approach] → [Outcome]

"Portfolio companies inherit complex technical debt that constrains 
growth and margin expansion. We conduct forensic assessments of 
architecture, security, and scalability, then build executable 
roadmaps that deliver measurable EBITDA improvement within 12-18 months."
```

**CTAs:**
```
[Direct Action] or [Function-Style Invocation]
"Schedule a Consultation"
"Download Framework"
"BOOK_CALENDAR_SLOT()"

**Typical Results:**
[Example scenario with inputs and outputs]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
## The Diligentizer

**Purpose:** Generate customized technical diligence checklists based on 
transaction parameters, tech stack, and risk profile.

**Use Case:** PE investors and corporate development teams use this during 
LOI stage to scope diligence requirements and budget consulting resources 
accurately.

**Inputs Required:**
- Transaction Size: $10M to $500M+ range
- Tech Stack: SaaS, E-commerce, FinTech, etc.
- Architecture: Monolith, Microservices, Hybrid
- Regulatory Environment: HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI-DSS, GDPR

```

### Grid Patterns

**Three-Column Card Grid:**
```
Desktop (≥1024px):  [Card] [Card] [Card]
Tablet (768-1023):  [Card] [Card]
                    [Card]
Mobile (<768px):    [Card]
                    [Card]
                    [Card]
```

**Specifications:**
- Gap: 32-48px between cards
- Card padding: 32-40px all sides
- Equal height cards in same row
- Stack order preserved on mobile

          [Sidebar]
```

**Dashboard/Metrics Grid:**
```
[Metric 1] [Metric 2] [Metric 3] [Metric 4]
(2x2 on tablet, 1x4 stack on mobile)
```

### Component Spacing

**Vertical Rhythm (Desktop):**
- Between major sections: 80-120px
- Between subsections: 64-96px
- Between related elements: 24-32px
- Between tightly coupled items: 8-16px
- Line height for body text: 1.6-1.7

**Horizontal Rhythm:**
- Maximum content width: 1200-1400px
- Side margins (desktop): Auto-center with min 40px
- Side margins (mobile): 16-24px
- Card/grid gaps: 32-48px desktop, 16-24px mobile

### Typography Scale (Reference)

```
H1: 48-72px (desktop) / 32-48px (mobile)
    Bold weight, tight line-height (1.1-1.2)
    
H2: 32-48px (desktop) / 24-32px (mobile)
    Semi-bold to bold, line-height 1.2-1.3
    
H3: 24-32px (desktop) / 20-24px (mobile)
    Medium to semi-bold, line-height 1.3-1.4

## Delta (Δ) Symbol Usage

### When to Use Delta

**Primary Applications:**
1. **Metric Presentation** - Showing change/impact
2. **Brand Signature** - Footer, headers, dividers
3. **Bullet/List Markers** - Alternative to standard bullets
4. **Section Dividers** - Visual break between content areas
5. **Logo Integration** - Part of GST brand mark

**Metric Examples:**
```
Δ Revenue: +$12.4M
Δ EBITDA: +$8.2M
Δ Efficiency: +42%
Δ Time to Market: -6 months
Δ Technical Debt: -$3.1M remediation avoided
```

**Content Structure Examples:**
```markdown
### Value Creation Portfolio

      Δ
      
Portfolio companies delivered measurable transformation across...

---

## Our Approach

Δ **Assess** - Forensic evaluation of current state
Δ **Architect** - Design target state with risk mitigation  
Δ **Accelerate** - Execute roadmap with embedded leadership
```

### Delta Implementation

**SVG Asset (Preferred for Visual Elements):**
```html
<img src="/images/gst-delta-icon-teal-stroke-thick.svg" 
     alt="Delta symbol" 
     class="delta-icon" />
```

**Asset Location:**
- Path: `public/images/gst-delta-icon-teal-stroke-thick.svg`
- Use for: Hero sections, decorative elements, card icons, large visual moments
- Advantages: Scalable, brand-specific styling (teal stroke), maintains visual consistency

**HTML Entity (For Inline Text):**
```html
&Delta; or &#916;
```

**Unicode (For Plain Text):**
```
\u0394
```

**CSS Content (For Pseudo-elements):**
```css
.delta-symbol::before {
  content: '\0394';
  margin-right: 0.25em;
}
```

**Icon Usage Decision Tree:**
- **Use SVG asset** when: Hero sections, card headers, decorative elements, 48px+ size
- **Use Unicode/HTML entity** when: Inline metrics, text bullets, body copy
- **Use CSS pseudo-element** when: Repeated pattern, list markers, consistent styling needed

**Markdown:**
```
Δ (copy/paste the Unicode character directly for metrics/text)
```

2. **Apply templates** appropriate to the content type (hero, card, article)
3. **Use Delta symbol** purposefully in metrics and brand moments
4. **Verify against checklist** before considering content complete
5. **Maintain audience focus** - always write for PE investors and C-suite executives

This skill complements the full Brand Guidelines document but focuses 
specifically on content architecture, copywriting patterns, and structural 
templates for website development.
