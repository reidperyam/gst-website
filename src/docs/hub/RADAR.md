# GST Radar: Curated Intelligence Feed

## Overview

The Radar is a curated intelligence feed on the GST Strategic Intelligence Hub at `/hub/radar`. It aggregates technology and M&A news from practitioner-grade sources, layered with editorial commentary.

**URL:** `https://globalstrategic.tech/hub/radar`

## Architecture

### Content Tiers

| Tier | Name | Source | Effort | Value |
|------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | The Wire | Automated RSS via Inoreader folders | Zero per item | Source curation signal |
| 2 | FYI | Inoreader annotated items (highlights + notes) | Seconds per item | Practitioner commentary |

Both tiers render in a **single unified feed**, sorted chronologically (FYI by annotation date, Wire by publish date). FYI items retain their visual distinction (expandable, category tag, GST Take) but appear inline among Wire items.

### Rendering Model

- **Radar page** (`/hub/radar`): Server-rendered with Vercel ISR (6-hour cache)
- **RadarFeed**: Loaded as an Astro **server island** (`server:defer`) — the page shell (header, category filter, footer) renders instantly while the feed streams in asynchronously
- **RadarFeedSkeleton**: Placeholder shown in the server island's `slot="fallback"` while feed data loads — renders 6 pulsing skeleton items mimicking wire-item layout
- **All other pages**: Unchanged, remain fully static

### Data Flow

```
Inoreader API ──► RadarFeed server island ──► Vercel ISR cache (6h) ──► Visitors
                  (streams into page shell)
```

No GitHub Action crons. No auto-committed JSON files. No manual rebuilds for feed content.

### Timestamp

The "Updated" timestamp in the page header (`RadarHeader.astro`) displays the server render time in the **America/Santiago** (Chile) timezone, regardless of where the Vercel edge function executes. This uses `toLocaleDateString('en-US', { timeZone: 'America/Santiago', ... })`.

## Environment Variables

Set in Vercel project settings and local `.env`:

| Variable | Purpose | Source |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `INOREADER_APP_ID` | Inoreader developer app ID | Manual (Inoreader dev portal) |
| `INOREADER_APP_KEY` | Inoreader developer app key | Manual (Inoreader dev portal) |
| `INOREADER_ACCESS_TOKEN` | OAuth access token (initial/fallback) | OAuth flow or Redis auto-refresh |
| `INOREADER_REFRESH_TOKEN` | OAuth refresh token (initial/fallback) | OAuth flow or Redis auto-refresh |
| `INOREADER_FOLDER_PREFIX` | Folder prefix filter (default: `GST-`) | Manual |
| `KV_REST_API_URL` | Upstash Redis REST endpoint | Auto-provisioned by Vercel Upstash integration |
| `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` | Upstash Redis auth token | Auto-provisioned by Vercel Upstash integration |

## Inoreader Setup

### Prerequisites
- Inoreader Pro plan (~$7.50/month)
- Register app at https://www.inoreader.com/developers/

### OAuth Setup

The script reads `INOREADER_APP_ID` and `INOREADER_APP_KEY` from the project root `.env` file automatically.

```bash
node scripts/inoreader-auth.mjs setup        # 1. Prints auth URL to open in browser
node scripts/inoreader-auth.mjs exchange CODE # 2. Exchange auth code for access + refresh tokens
node scripts/inoreader-auth.mjs refresh       # 3. Manual fallback if refresh token needs rotation
```

Do steps 1-2 quickly back-to-back — auth codes expire within minutes. The exchange command prints both `INOREADER_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `INOREADER_REFRESH_TOKEN` to add to `.env` and Vercel env vars.

### Folder Organization

Create folders in Inoreader prefixed with `GST-`:

| Folder | Category | Content |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `GST-PE-MA` | PE & M&A | Deal activity, fund strategies |
| `GST-Enterprise-Tech` | Enterprise Tech | Cloud, infrastructure, platforms |
| `GST-AI-Automation` | AI & Automation | Enterprise AI, ML ops |
| `GST-Security` | Security | Cybersecurity, regulatory |

### Annotation Workflow (Publishing to FYI)

1. Read an article in Inoreader
2. Highlight a key passage
3. Add a note with practitioner context (becomes "Δ GST Take")
4. Optionally tag with `gst-[category]` for category override

### FYI Content Retention

FYI items have no time-based expiry on the GST side. Visibility is determined by a **most-recent-N window**:

- The Radar fetches the **30 most recent** annotated items from Inoreader each ISR cycle
- An item remains visible until it falls outside that top-30 window (i.e., 30+ newer annotations push it off)
- Removing annotations (highlights/notes) in Inoreader also removes the item
- There is up to a **6-hour stale window** between an item leaving the API and disappearing from the page (due to ISR cache)

## Page UX Features

### Unified Feed

FYI and Wire items render in a single chronological feed below the category filter. The `mergeFeed()` helper in `transform.ts` combines both tiers, sorting FYI items by `annotatedAt` and Wire items by `publishedAt`.

Individual FYI items use native `<details>`/`<summary>` for expand/collapse of their summary, highlight, and GST Take content.

### Category Filter with Gravity Spacing

The category filter pills (`CategoryFilter.astro`) use a gravitational spacing effect:

- Pills are center-justified with `justify-content: center`
- A client-side script computes each button's normalized distance from center (`--d`: 0 at center, 1 at edges)
- CSS uses `--d` squared to calculate horizontal margin: `calc(var(--spacing-xs) + var(--d) * var(--d) * 1.6rem)`
- Center buttons cluster tightly together; edge buttons have progressively wider spacing
- On mobile (< 480px), pills switch to horizontal scroll with uniform spacing

## Token Management

### How Token Refresh Works

The API client handles token refresh automatically at runtime:

1. Each API call uses the current access token (resolved from Redis or env var)
2. If Inoreader returns **401** (token expired), the client automatically uses the refresh token to obtain a **new access token AND a new refresh token**
3. Both new tokens are **persisted to Upstash Redis** so they survive across serverless invocations
4. Subsequent API calls in the same page render reuse the in-memory refreshed token
5. The next ISR invocation (up to 6 hours later) loads the Redis-stored tokens automatically

### Token Resolution Priority

When resolving credentials, the client checks three sources in order:

| Priority | Source | When Used |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | In-memory refresh | Token was refreshed during this SSR invocation |
| 2 | Upstash Redis store | Token was refreshed by a previous invocation and persisted |
| 3 | Environment variable | Initial setup value; used when Redis is empty or unavailable |

### Upstash Redis Persistence

Tokens are stored in Upstash Redis (Upstash Redis) to survive across serverless invocations:

| Redis Key | Value | TTL |
|--------|-------|-----|
| `inoreader:access_token` | OAuth access token | 30 days |
| `inoreader:refresh_token` | OAuth refresh token | 30 days |

**Why this matters:** Without Redis, each serverless invocation starts fresh with the original env var tokens. When Inoreader's refresh endpoint returns a new refresh token (which it does on every refresh), the old refresh token may be invalidated. Without persistence, the next invocation would try to use the now-invalid original refresh token from the env var — eventually causing a permanent auth failure.

With Redis, the refreshed token chain stays alive indefinitely — each refresh stores the new pair, and the next invocation picks it up.

**Graceful degradation:** All Redis operations are wrapped in try/catch. If Redis is unavailable (dev mode, quota exceeded, not configured), the client silently falls back to env vars — matching the pre-Redis behavior.

### Redis Setup

Redis is provisioned via the Upstash integration in the Vercel Marketplace (free tier: 10,000 commands/day, 256MB):

1. **Vercel Dashboard → Storage → Upstash** → Create a Redis database named `gst-radar-tokens`
2. **Connect to the project** — Upstash auto-provisions `KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` env vars
3. **Redeploy** — the code detects Redis automatically via `@upstash/redis`

No code changes or local env var setup needed. For local development, Redis is not used — the client reads tokens from `.env` as usual.

### Environment Variables for Redis

These are auto-provisioned when you connect an Upstash Redis store to the project:

| Variable | Purpose | Source |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `KV_REST_API_URL` | Upstash Redis REST endpoint | Auto-set by Vercel Upstash integration |
| `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` | Upstash Redis auth token | Auto-set by Vercel Upstash integration |

### Manual Fallback

The manual refresh script (`node scripts/inoreader-auth.mjs refresh`) remains available if the entire token chain breaks (e.g., Redis store deleted, both tokens expired). In that case, re-run the full OAuth flow and update the Vercel env vars.

## Dev-Mode API Cache

### Why It Exists

Inoreader enforces a **200 requests/day** rate limit (100/zone x 2 zones). Each Radar page load makes ~7 API calls (1 annotated items + 1 tag list + ~5 folder streams). During local development, hot reloads and page refreshes can exhaust this budget in under 15 page loads, resulting in **429 Too Many Requests** errors and a blank Radar feed.

Production is unaffected (ISR revalidates every 6 hours = ~28 calls/day), but the dev and production environments share the same API credentials and rate limit bucket.

### How It Works

When `import.meta.env.DEV` is true (local dev server only), the API client in `src/lib/inoreader/client.ts` checks a file cache before making real API calls:

1. Before each API call, the client checks `.cache/inoreader/` for a cached response
2. Cache files are keyed by function name + parameters (SHA-256 hash)
3. If a valid cache file exists (< 24 hours old), it is returned immediately — no API call made
4. If no cache exists or it has expired, the real API call proceeds and the response is stored

Cache logic lives in `src/lib/inoreader/cache.ts`.

### Cache Location & Cleanup

- **Directory**: `.cache/inoreader/` (project root, gitignored)
- **TTL**: 24 hours (hardcoded)
- **Manual clear**: Delete the `.cache/` directory to force fresh API calls on next page load
- **Production**: Cache is completely bypassed — `import.meta.env.DEV` is `false` in Vercel builds

### Console Output

During dev, the cache logs its behavior to the terminal:

```
[Radar] Dev cache hit: fetchAnnotatedItems        # using cached response
[Radar] Dev cache stored: fetchAllStreams          # fresh response saved
```

## Working Offline / Rate-Limited Development

When the Inoreader API rate limit (200 requests/day) has been exhausted — or when working without network access — you can seed the dev cache with mock data so the Radar page renders fully without any live API calls.

### Quick Start

```bash
npm run radar:seed
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:4321/hub/radar — renders with mock data, zero API calls
```

The `radar:seed` script writes two cache entries into `.cache/inoreader/` with a fresh timestamp (24h TTL). Start the dev server normally afterward.

### How It Works

The seed script (`tests/e2e/fixtures/seed-radar-cache.ts`) writes the same cache files the dev-mode cache system reads. The Astro dev server sees valid cache entries and skips all Inoreader API calls. The mock data includes:

- **5 FYI items** with annotations (highlights + GST Take) across all 4 categories
- **13 Wire items** across all 4 GST-* folders with realistic titles and sources

### Resetting to Live Data

When you're ready to return to live API data:

```bash
npm run radar:unseed       # Remove seeded mock data
npm run dev                # Next page load fetches from Inoreader and re-caches
```

### Preserving Real Cache Data

If you've already loaded the Radar page with live data and want to keep that cache for offline use, the files in `.cache/inoreader/` persist across dev server restarts. The 24-hour TTL is based on a `timestamp` field stored inside each JSON file, not the file modification time.

To extend expired cache entries without re-fetching:

```bash
# Reset the timestamp inside each cache file to "now"
npx tsx -e "
import { readdirSync, readFileSync, writeFileSync } from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';
const dir = '.cache/inoreader';
for (const f of readdirSync(dir)) {
  const p = join(dir, f);
  const entry = JSON.parse(readFileSync(p, 'utf-8'));
  entry.timestamp = Date.now();
  writeFileSync(p, JSON.stringify(entry), 'utf-8');
}
console.log('Cache timestamps refreshed');
"
```

## E2E Test Mocking

### Why Mock Data Is Needed

The Radar page is **server-side rendered** — Inoreader API calls happen in the Astro dev server (Node.js), not in the browser. This means Playwright's `page.route()` cannot intercept these calls. Without mock data, E2E tests either burn through the 200 req/day API budget or silently skip when the API is rate-limited.

### How It Works

E2E tests reuse the dev-mode file cache (see above) to serve deterministic mock data:

1. **Playwright global setup** (`tests/e2e/global-setup.ts`) writes mock Inoreader responses to `.cache/inoreader/` before any test runs
2. The Astro dev server reads these cache files during SSR — zero live API calls
3. **Playwright global teardown** (`tests/e2e/global-teardown.ts`) cleans up the cache after tests complete

Only two cache entries are needed:
- `fetchAnnotatedItems(30)` — seeds 5 FYI items across all 4 categories
- `fetchAllStreams('GST-', 15)` — seeds 13 Wire items across all 4 folders

### File Structure

```
tests/e2e/
├── global-setup.ts              # Seeds mock cache before tests
├── global-teardown.ts           # Clears mock cache after tests
├── fixtures/
│   ├── radar-mock-data.ts       # Mock Inoreader API response factories
│   └── seed-radar-cache.ts      # Writes/clears mock data in .cache/
├── helpers/
│   └── radar.ts                 # Page interaction helpers
└── radar-page.test.ts           # Radar E2E tests (17 tests x 3 browsers)
```

### Cache Key Alignment

The seeding script duplicates `buildCacheKey()` from `src/lib/inoreader/cache.ts` (same SHA-256 hashing of function name + args). If the cache key algorithm changes, E2E tests break immediately — providing fast feedback.

### Mock Data Characteristics

- **FYI items**: 5 articles with annotations (highlighted text + GST Take), covering all 4 categories
- **Wire items**: 13 articles spread across 4 GST-* folders with realistic titles and sources
- All items have valid URLs, timestamps, sources, and category folder labels
- Category distribution is intentionally uneven so filter tests can verify count changes
- Both tiers render in a single unified feed, interleaved chronologically

### Running Radar E2E Tests

```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/radar-page.test.ts              # All browsers
npx playwright test tests/e2e/radar-page.test.ts --project=chromium  # Chromium only
```

Console output confirms mock data is active:
```
[E2E Setup] Radar mock cache seeded
...
[E2E Teardown] Radar mock cache cleared
```

## Vercel Caching & ISR Details

### How ISR Works for the Radar

The Radar page uses **Incremental Static Regeneration** configured in `astro.config.mjs`:

```js
adapter: vercel({
  isr: {
    expiration: 60 * 60 * 6, // 6 hours (21,600 seconds)
  },
})
```

Because the page sets `export const prerender = false`, Astro delegates it to a Vercel serverless function (`_isr.func`) rather than generating static HTML at build time.

### Cache Lifecycle

1. **First request after deploy** — Vercel invokes the ISR function:
   - Fetches Wire items from Inoreader API (up to 30 across `GST-` folders)
   - Fetches FYI items from Inoreader annotated stream (up to 30)
   - Renders full HTML and **caches the result for 6 hours**
2. **Requests within 6 hours** — Vercel serves the **cached HTML from CDN**. No serverless function runs, no Inoreader API calls.
3. **First request after 6 hours** — **Stale-while-revalidate** pattern:
   - The visitor **immediately gets the stale cached version** (no wait)
   - Vercel **re-renders the page in the background** with fresh API calls
   - The **next visitor** after the background render completes gets fresh content
4. **If background render fails** — Vercel continues serving the last successfully cached version until the next revalidation attempt.

### What Refreshes When

| Content | Refresh Trigger | Frequency |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| The Wire (RSS feeds) | ISR revalidation | Every 6 hours |
| FYI (annotated items) | ISR revalidation | Every 6 hours |
| Static assets (JS/CSS) | Vercel deployment | Immutable, 1-year cache |

### Vercel Routing

Vercel generates routing rules that send `/hub/radar` requests to the ISR function:

```
/hub/radar → /_isr?x_astro_path=/hub/radar
```

The prerender config (`.vercel/output/functions/_isr.prerender-config.json`) sets:
- `expiration: 21600` (6 hours)
- `allowQuery: ["x_astro_path"]`
- `passQuery: true`

## Error Handling

- **API down**: Radar page renders with empty FYI/Wire sections and fallback message
- **Token expired**: Automatic refresh via refresh token; both new tokens persisted to Upstash Redis
- **Refresh token expired**: Should not happen if Redis is configured (each refresh stores a new pair). If it does, re-run OAuth flow (`node scripts/inoreader-auth.mjs setup`) and update Vercel env vars
- **No env vars**: Radar page shows "Intelligence feed is currently being refreshed" fallback
- **ISR cache**: Vercel serves last good render even during API outages

### Failure Scenarios in Detail

| Scenario | User Sees | ISR Cache Impact | Logged |
|----------|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Inoreader API temporarily down | Fallback message | Degraded page cached for 6h | `[Radar] Inoreader API error: {status}` |
| Access token expired (refresh works) | **Normal page** — auto-heals | Good page cached | `[Radar] Access token expired, attempting refresh...` + `Tokens persisted to KV store` |
| Refresh token revoked/expired (no Redis) | Fallback message | Degraded page cached for 6h | `[Radar] Token refresh failed: {status}` |
| Refresh token revoked (with Redis) | **Unlikely** — Redis stores fresh pair on each refresh | N/A | Should not occur if Redis is healthy |
| Both tokens invalid + Redis empty | Fallback message | Degraded page cached for 6h | `[Radar] Token refresh failed` |
| Redis unavailable | Falls back to env vars | No impact if env vars are valid | `[Radar] KV read failed, falling back to env vars` |
| Env vars missing entirely | **Page render crashes** | No cache generated | `Inoreader credentials not configured` error |
| Network timeout to Inoreader | Fallback message | Degraded page cached for 6h | `[Radar] Wire fetch failed` / `Folder fetch failed` |

**Key risk (mitigated by Redis):** Previously, if the refresh token expired, Vercel ISR would cache a degraded page indefinitely with no alerting. With Upstash Redis, each successful refresh persists a new token pair, keeping the chain alive. The remaining risk is if the Redis store is deleted or both the Redis-stored and env var tokens expire simultaneously — an unlikely scenario under normal operation.

## Production Observability & Troubleshooting

### Current Logging

The Inoreader client (`src/lib/inoreader/client.ts`) logs to `console.error` / `console.warn` / `console.log` with a `[Radar]` prefix at every failure point. These logs are captured by Vercel's serverless function runtime.

**Log messages to watch for:**

| Log Message | Severity | Meaning |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| `[Radar] Access token expired, attempting refresh...` | Warn | Normal — token rotation in progress |
| `[Radar] Access token refreshed successfully` | Info | Normal — self-healed |
| `[Radar] Loaded tokens from KV store` | Info | Normal — using Redis-persisted tokens |
| `[Radar] Tokens persisted to KV store` | Info | Normal — fresh tokens saved for next invocation |
| `[Radar] KV read failed, falling back to env vars` | Warn | Redis unavailable — using env vars instead |
| `[Radar] KV write failed (non-fatal)` | Warn | Redis persistence failed — tokens still work in-memory |
| `[Radar] Token refresh failed: {status}` | Error | **Action needed** — refresh token may be revoked |
| `[Radar] No refresh token available` | Error | **Action needed** — env var missing |
| `[Radar] Request failed after token refresh: {status}` | Error | API issue persists after token refresh |
| `[Radar] Inoreader API error: {status} {statusText}` | Error | Inoreader returned non-200 |
| `[Radar] Wire fetch failed` | Error | Network error fetching folders |
| `[Radar] No folders found with prefix "GST-"` | Warn | No matching folders — check Inoreader organization |

### How to View Logs

1. **Vercel Dashboard** → Project → **Logs** tab
2. Filter by function: `_isr`
3. Search for `[Radar]` to isolate Radar-specific logs
4. Logs are available for ~24–72 hours depending on Vercel plan

### Verifying It's Working

**Quick manual check:**
- Visit `/hub/radar` — if the unified feed shows FYI and Wire items, it's working
- Empty feed with fallback message indicates an API or token problem

**Vercel dashboard checks:**
- **Logs tab**: Filter for `[Radar]` errors in recent ISR invocations
- **Functions tab**: Check that the `_isr` function is being invoked and returning 200
- **Deployments tab**: View function logs for a specific deployment

### What Does NOT Exist (Current Gaps)

- No Sentry or external error tracking integration
- No alerting (Slack, email, PagerDuty) on API failures
- No health check endpoint (e.g., `/api/radar-health`)
- No structured logging (only console output)
- No retry logic beyond token refresh — single attempt per API call, then returns `null`

### Troubleshooting Playbook

**Symptom: Feed is empty on the live site**

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Logs → filter for `[Radar]`
2. Look for `Token refresh failed` → refresh token is dead
   - Fix: Re-run OAuth flow and update Vercel env vars:
     ```bash
     node scripts/inoreader-auth.mjs setup        # Get new auth URL
     node scripts/inoreader-auth.mjs exchange CODE # Get new tokens
     ```
   - Update `INOREADER_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `INOREADER_REFRESH_TOKEN` in Vercel project settings
   - Redeploy or wait up to 6 hours for ISR to pick up the new env vars
3. Look for `Inoreader API error: 429` → rate limited
   - Wait and let the next ISR cycle retry (6 hours)
4. Look for `Wire fetch failed` or `Folder fetch failed` → network issue
   - Usually transient; next ISR cycle should recover
5. Look for `No folders found with prefix "GST-"` → Inoreader folder naming issue
   - Verify folders in Inoreader are prefixed with `GST-`

**Symptom: Page crashes / 500 error**

1. Check Vercel function logs for the error
2. Most likely cause: missing environment variables
3. Verify all five env vars are set in Vercel project settings

**Symptom: Content is stale (not updating)**

1. Content refreshes every 6 hours via ISR — wait for the next cycle
2. To force a refresh: trigger a redeployment from Vercel dashboard

## Category Inference

Priority order:
1. Explicit `gst-*` tag on the Inoreader item
2. GST-* folder membership
3. Keyword matching from article title
4. Default: `enterprise-tech`
