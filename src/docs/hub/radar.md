# GST Radar: Curated Intelligence Feed

## Overview

The Radar is a curated intelligence feed on the GST Strategic Intelligence Hub at `/hub/radar`. It aggregates technology and M&A news from practitioner-grade sources, layered with editorial commentary.

**URL:** `https://globalstrategic.tech/hub/radar`

## Architecture

### Content Tiers

| Tier | Name | Source | Effort | Value |
|------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | The Wire | Automated RSS via Inoreader folders | Zero per item | Source curation signal |
| 2 | FYI | Inoreader annotated items (highlights + notes) | Seconds per item | Practitioner commentary |
| 3 | Signals | Original markdown posts in `src/content/signals/` | 30-60 min per post | Original indexed content |

### Rendering Model

- **Radar page** (`/hub/radar`): Server-rendered with Vercel ISR (6-hour cache)
- **Signal posts** (`/hub/radar/signals/[slug]`): Static HTML at build time
- **All other pages**: Unchanged, remain fully static

### Data Flow

```
Inoreader API ──► Astro SSR page ──► Vercel ISR cache (6h) ──► Visitors
                       ▲
src/content/signals/ ──┘ (markdown, at build time)
```

No GitHub Action crons. No auto-committed JSON files. No manual rebuilds for feed content.

## Environment Variables

Set in Vercel project settings and local `.env`:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `INOREADER_APP_ID` | Inoreader developer app ID |
| `INOREADER_APP_KEY` | Inoreader developer app key |
| `INOREADER_ACCESS_TOKEN` | OAuth access token |
| `INOREADER_REFRESH_TOKEN` | OAuth refresh token |
| `INOREADER_FOLDER_PREFIX` | Folder prefix filter (default: `GST-`) |

## Inoreader Setup

### Prerequisites
- Inoreader Pro plan (~$7.50/month)
- Register app at https://www.inoreader.com/developers/

### OAuth Setup

The script reads `INOREADER_APP_ID` and `INOREADER_APP_KEY` from the project root `.env` file automatically.

```bash
node scripts/inoreader-auth.mjs setup        # 1. Prints auth URL to open in browser
node scripts/inoreader-auth.mjs exchange CODE # 2. Exchange auth code for access + refresh tokens
node scripts/inoreader-auth.mjs refresh       # 3. Manual fallback if refresh token needs rotation
```

Do steps 1-2 quickly back-to-back — auth codes expire within minutes. The exchange command prints both `INOREADER_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `INOREADER_REFRESH_TOKEN` to add to `.env` and Vercel env vars.

### Folder Organization

Create folders in Inoreader prefixed with `GST-`:

| Folder | Category | Content |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `GST-PE-MA` | PE & M&A | Deal activity, fund strategies |
| `GST-Enterprise-Tech` | Enterprise Tech | Cloud, infrastructure, platforms |
| `GST-AI-Automation` | AI & Automation | Enterprise AI, ML ops |
| `GST-Security` | Security | Cybersecurity, regulatory |
| `GST-Verticals` | Industry | Healthcare IT, fintech, vertical SaaS |

### Annotation Workflow (Publishing to FYI)

1. Read an article in Inoreader
2. Highlight a key passage
3. Add a note with practitioner context (becomes "Δ GST Take")
4. Optionally tag with `gst-[category]` for category override

## Page UX Features

### Collapsible Sections

Each content tier (Signals, FYI, The Wire) is wrapped in a native `<details>`/`<summary>` element:

- **Default state**: All sections open
- **Toggle indicator**: `+` (collapsed) / `−` (expanded) on the left side of each section header
- **Hover**: Toggle turns green (`--color-primary`)
- **localStorage persistence**: Section open/closed states are saved to `localStorage` key `radar-sections` (format: `{"signals": true, "fyi": false, "wire": true}`). On return visits, saved preferences override the default open state.
- **Pattern**: Follows the same `<details>`/`<summary>` approach used in `FyiItem.astro` for individual FYI items, and the `ThemeToggle.astro` try/catch pattern for localStorage access.

### Category Filter with Gravity Spacing

The category filter pills (`CategoryFilter.astro`) use a gravitational spacing effect:

- Pills are center-justified with `justify-content: center`
- A client-side script computes each button's normalized distance from center (`--d`: 0 at center, 1 at edges)
- CSS uses `--d` squared to calculate horizontal margin: `calc(var(--spacing-xs) + var(--d) * var(--d) * 1.6rem)`
- Center buttons cluster tightly together; edge buttons have progressively wider spacing
- On mobile (< 480px), pills switch to horizontal scroll with uniform spacing

```

## Adding a Signal Post

1. Create a markdown file in `src/content/signals/`:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Signal Title"
description: "Brief description for card preview."
publishedAt: 2026-02-23
category: "ai-automation"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---

Your full post content here...
```

2. Push to trigger Vercel build
3. The post appears on the Radar page and gets its own URL

## Token Management

The API client handles token refresh automatically at runtime:

1. Each API call uses the stored `INOREADER_ACCESS_TOKEN`
2. If Inoreader returns **401** (token expired), the client automatically uses `INOREADER_REFRESH_TOKEN` to obtain a new access token
3. The refreshed token is cached in memory for the remainder of that SSR render
4. Subsequent API calls in the same page render reuse the refreshed token

**No manual token rotation needed.** As long as the refresh token remains valid (long-lived, typically months), the client self-heals on every ISR revalidation cycle.

The manual refresh script (`node scripts/inoreader-auth.mjs refresh`) is available as a fallback if the refresh token itself expires, which would require re-running the full OAuth flow.

## Dev-Mode API Cache

### Why It Exists

Inoreader enforces a **200 requests/day** rate limit (100/zone x 2 zones). Each Radar page load makes ~7 API calls (1 annotated items + 1 tag list + ~5 folder streams). During local development, hot reloads and page refreshes can exhaust this budget in under 15 page loads, resulting in **429 Too Many Requests** errors and a blank Radar feed.

Production is unaffected (ISR revalidates every 6 hours = ~28 calls/day), but the dev and production environments share the same API credentials and rate limit bucket.

### How It Works

When `import.meta.env.DEV` is true (local dev server only), the API client in `src/lib/inoreader/client.ts` checks a file cache before making real API calls:

1. Before each API call, the client checks `.cache/inoreader/` for a cached response
2. Cache files are keyed by function name + parameters (SHA-256 hash)
3. If a valid cache file exists (< 24 hours old), it is returned immediately — no API call made
4. If no cache exists or it has expired, the real API call proceeds and the response is stored

Cache logic lives in `src/lib/inoreader/cache.ts`.

### Cache Location & Cleanup

- **Directory**: `.cache/inoreader/` (project root, gitignored)
- **TTL**: 24 hours (hardcoded)
- **Manual clear**: Delete the `.cache/` directory to force fresh API calls on next page load
- **Production**: Cache is completely bypassed — `import.meta.env.DEV` is `false` in Vercel builds

### Console Output

During dev, the cache logs its behavior to the terminal:

```
[Radar] Dev cache hit: fetchAnnotatedItems        # using cached response
[Radar] Dev cache stored: fetchAllStreams          # fresh response saved
```

## Working Offline / Rate-Limited Development

When the Inoreader API rate limit (200 requests/day) has been exhausted — or when working without network access — you can seed the dev cache with mock data so the Radar page renders fully without any live API calls.

### Quick Start

Run the E2E seed script directly with `tsx`:

```bash
npx tsx -e "import { seedRadarCache } from './tests/e2e/fixtures/seed-radar-cache'; seedRadarCache();"
```

This writes two cache entries into `.cache/inoreader/` with a fresh timestamp (24h TTL). Start the dev server normally afterward:

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:4321/hub/radar — renders with mock data, zero API calls
```

### How It Works

The seed script (`tests/e2e/fixtures/seed-radar-cache.ts`) writes the same cache files the dev-mode cache system reads. The Astro dev server sees valid cache entries and skips all Inoreader API calls. The mock data includes:

- **6 FYI items** with annotations (highlights + GST Take) across all 5 categories
- **16 Wire items** across all 5 GST-* folders with realistic titles and sources

### Resetting to Live Data

When you're ready to return to live API data:

```bash
rm -rf .cache/inoreader    # Remove seeded mock data
npm run dev                # Next page load fetches from Inoreader and re-caches
```

### Preserving Real Cache Data

If you've already loaded the Radar page with live data and want to keep that cache for offline use, the files in `.cache/inoreader/` persist across dev server restarts. The 24-hour TTL is based on a `timestamp` field stored inside each JSON file, not the file modification time.

To extend expired cache entries without re-fetching:

```bash
# Reset the timestamp inside each cache file to "now"
npx tsx -e "
import { readdirSync, readFileSync, writeFileSync } from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';
const dir = '.cache/inoreader';
for (const f of readdirSync(dir)) {
  const p = join(dir, f);
  const entry = JSON.parse(readFileSync(p, 'utf-8'));
  entry.timestamp = Date.now();
  writeFileSync(p, JSON.stringify(entry), 'utf-8');
}
console.log('Cache timestamps refreshed');
"
```

## E2E Test Mocking

### Why Mock Data Is Needed

The Radar page is **server-side rendered** — Inoreader API calls happen in the Astro dev server (Node.js), not in the browser. This means Playwright's `page.route()` cannot intercept these calls. Without mock data, E2E tests either burn through the 200 req/day API budget or silently skip when the API is rate-limited.

### How It Works

E2E tests reuse the dev-mode file cache (see above) to serve deterministic mock data:

1. **Playwright global setup** (`tests/e2e/global-setup.ts`) writes mock Inoreader responses to `.cache/inoreader/` before any test runs
2. The Astro dev server reads these cache files during SSR — zero live API calls
3. **Playwright global teardown** (`tests/e2e/global-teardown.ts`) cleans up the cache after tests complete

Only two cache entries are needed:
- `fetchAnnotatedItems(30)` — seeds 6 FYI items across all 5 categories
- `fetchAllStreams('GST-', 15)` — seeds 16 Wire items across all 5 folders

### File Structure

```
tests/e2e/
├── global-setup.ts              # Seeds mock cache before tests
├── global-teardown.ts           # Clears mock cache after tests
├── fixtures/
│   ├── radar-mock-data.ts       # Mock Inoreader API response factories
│   └── seed-radar-cache.ts      # Writes/clears mock data in .cache/
├── helpers/
│   └── radar.ts                 # Page interaction helpers
└── radar-page.test.ts           # Radar E2E tests (17 tests x 3 browsers)
```

### Cache Key Alignment

The seeding script duplicates `buildCacheKey()` from `src/lib/inoreader/cache.ts` (same SHA-256 hashing of function name + args). If the cache key algorithm changes, E2E tests break immediately — providing fast feedback.

### Mock Data Characteristics

- **FYI items**: 6 articles with annotations (highlighted text + GST Take), covering all 5 categories
- **Wire items**: 16 articles spread across 5 GST-* folders with realistic titles and sources
- All items have valid URLs, timestamps, sources, and category folder labels
- Category distribution is intentionally uneven so filter tests can verify count changes

### Running Radar E2E Tests

```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/radar-page.test.ts              # All browsers
npx playwright test tests/e2e/radar-page.test.ts --project=chromium  # Chromium only
```

Console output confirms mock data is active:
```
[E2E Setup] Radar mock cache seeded
...
[E2E Teardown] Radar mock cache cleared
```

## Vercel Caching & ISR Details

### How ISR Works for the Radar

The Radar page uses **Incremental Static Regeneration** configured in `astro.config.mjs`:

```js
adapter: vercel({
  isr: {
    expiration: 60 * 60 * 6, // 6 hours (21,600 seconds)
  },
})
```

Because the page sets `export const prerender = false`, Astro delegates it to a Vercel serverless function (`_isr.func`) rather than generating static HTML at build time.

### Cache Lifecycle

1. **First request after deploy** — Vercel invokes the ISR function:
   - Fetches Wire items from Inoreader API (up to 30 across `GST-` folders)
   - Fetches FYI items from Inoreader annotated stream (up to 30)
   - Loads Signals from the content collection (markdown, resolved at build time)
   - Renders full HTML and **caches the result for 6 hours**
2. **Requests within 6 hours** — Vercel serves the **cached HTML from CDN**. No serverless function runs, no Inoreader API calls.
3. **First request after 6 hours** — **Stale-while-revalidate** pattern:
   - The visitor **immediately gets the stale cached version** (no wait)
   - Vercel **re-renders the page in the background** with fresh API calls
   - The **next visitor** after the background render completes gets fresh content
4. **If background render fails** — Vercel continues serving the last successfully cached version until the next revalidation attempt.

### What Refreshes When

| Content | Refresh Trigger | Frequency |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| The Wire (RSS feeds) | ISR revalidation | Every 6 hours |
| FYI (annotated items) | ISR revalidation | Every 6 hours |
| Signals (original posts) | Vercel deployment | On each push/deploy |
| Static assets (JS/CSS) | Vercel deployment | Immutable, 1-year cache |

### Vercel Routing

Vercel generates routing rules that send `/hub/radar` requests to the ISR function:

```
/hub/radar → /_isr?x_astro_path=/hub/radar
```

The prerender config (`.vercel/output/functions/_isr.prerender-config.json`) sets:
- `expiration: 21600` (6 hours)
- `allowQuery: ["x_astro_path"]`
- `passQuery: true`

## Error Handling

- **API down**: Radar page renders with empty FYI/Wire sections; Signals still show
- **Token expired**: Automatic refresh via refresh token; no manual intervention needed
- **Refresh token expired**: Re-run OAuth flow (`node scripts/inoreader-auth.mjs setup`) and update Vercel env vars
- **No env vars**: Radar page shows "Intelligence feed is currently being refreshed" fallback
- **ISR cache**: Vercel serves last good render even during API outages

### Failure Scenarios in Detail

| Scenario | User Sees | ISR Cache Impact | Logged |
|----------|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Inoreader API temporarily down | Signals only + fallback message | Degraded page cached for 6h | `[Radar] Inoreader API error: {status}` |
| Access token expired (refresh works) | **Normal page** — auto-heals | Good page cached | `[Radar] Access token expired, attempting refresh...` + success |
| Refresh token revoked/expired | Signals only + fallback message | Degraded page cached for 6h | `[Radar] Token refresh failed: {status}` |
| Both tokens invalid | Signals only + fallback message | Degraded page cached for 6h | `[Radar] Token refresh failed` |
| Env vars missing entirely | **Page render crashes** | No cache generated | `Inoreader credentials not configured` error |
| Network timeout to Inoreader | Signals only + fallback message | Degraded page cached for 6h | `[Radar] Wire fetch failed` / `Folder fetch failed` |

**Key risk:** If tokens go permanently bad, Vercel ISR caches the degraded page for 6 hours, then re-renders another degraded page for another 6 hours, indefinitely — with no automatic alerting.

## Production Observability & Troubleshooting

### Current Logging

The Inoreader client (`src/lib/inoreader/client.ts`) logs to `console.error` / `console.warn` / `console.log` with a `[Radar]` prefix at every failure point. These logs are captured by Vercel's serverless function runtime.

**Log messages to watch for:**

| Log Message | Severity | Meaning |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| `[Radar] Access token expired, attempting refresh...` | Warn | Normal — token rotation in progress |
| `[Radar] Access token refreshed successfully` | Info | Normal — self-healed |
| `[Radar] Token refresh failed: {status}` | Error | **Action needed** — refresh token may be revoked |
| `[Radar] No refresh token available` | Error | **Action needed** — env var missing |
| `[Radar] Request failed after token refresh: {status}` | Error | API issue persists after token refresh |
| `[Radar] Inoreader API error: {status} {statusText}` | Error | Inoreader returned non-200 |
| `[Radar] Wire fetch failed` | Error | Network error fetching folders |
| `[Radar] No folders found with prefix "GST-"` | Warn | No matching folders — check Inoreader organization |

### How to View Logs

1. **Vercel Dashboard** → Project → **Logs** tab
2. Filter by function: `_isr`
3. Search for `[Radar]` to isolate Radar-specific logs
4. Logs are available for ~24–72 hours depending on Vercel plan

### Verifying It's Working

**Quick manual check:**
- Visit `/hub/radar` — if FYI and Wire sections are populated, it's working
- Empty FYI/Wire with only Signals visible indicates an API or token problem

**Vercel dashboard checks:**
- **Logs tab**: Filter for `[Radar]` errors in recent ISR invocations
- **Functions tab**: Check that the `_isr` function is being invoked and returning 200
- **Deployments tab**: View function logs for a specific deployment

### What Does NOT Exist (Current Gaps)

- No Sentry or external error tracking integration
- No alerting (Slack, email, PagerDuty) on API failures
- No health check endpoint (e.g., `/api/radar-health`)
- No structured logging (only console output)
- No retry logic — single attempt per API call, then returns `null`

### Troubleshooting Playbook

**Symptom: FYI and Wire sections are empty on the live site**

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Logs → filter for `[Radar]`
2. Look for `Token refresh failed` → refresh token is dead
   - Fix: Re-run OAuth flow and update Vercel env vars:
     ```bash
     node scripts/inoreader-auth.mjs setup        # Get new auth URL
     node scripts/inoreader-auth.mjs exchange CODE # Get new tokens
     ```
   - Update `INOREADER_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `INOREADER_REFRESH_TOKEN` in Vercel project settings
   - Redeploy or wait up to 6 hours for ISR to pick up the new env vars
3. Look for `Inoreader API error: 429` → rate limited
   - Wait and let the next ISR cycle retry (6 hours)
4. Look for `Wire fetch failed` or `Folder fetch failed` → network issue
   - Usually transient; next ISR cycle should recover
5. Look for `No folders found with prefix "GST-"` → Inoreader folder naming issue
   - Verify folders in Inoreader are prefixed with `GST-`

**Symptom: Page crashes / 500 error**

1. Check Vercel function logs for the error
2. Most likely cause: missing environment variables
3. Verify all five env vars are set in Vercel project settings

**Symptom: Content is stale (not updating)**

1. Content refreshes every 6 hours via ISR — wait for the next cycle
2. To force a refresh: trigger a redeployment from Vercel dashboard
3. Signal posts (markdown) only update on deploy — push a commit to trigger

## Category Inference

Priority order:
1. Explicit `gst-*` tag on the Inoreader item
2. GST-* folder membership
3. Keyword matching from article title
4. Default: `enterprise-tech`
