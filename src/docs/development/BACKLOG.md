# Development Backlog

Consolidated backlog of open development initiatives for the GST website. Each item is a self-contained user story with enough context to design and implement a solution. Items are grouped by theme, not priority — triage happens separately.

> **Completed and closed items**: 30 items were completed or closed through April 2026 (BL-002, 003, 008–019, 021–026, 027–030, 036–041). Use `git log` to find their original acceptance criteria and technical context.
>
> **BL-034** was previously closed and has been re-opened with new scope as the MCP-server doc-cleanup catch-all (April 2026). The historical BL-034 contents are reachable via `git log -- src/docs/development/BACKLOG.md`.

## Compliance and Privacy

### BL-001: Cookie Consent and GDPR Compliance

**Source**: BUSINESS_ENABLEMENT_V1.md | **Effort**: 2 days | **Status**: Open

**As a** site operator, **I want** a cookie consent mechanism that gates all tracking (GA4, Sentry) behind explicit user consent **so that** the site complies with GDPR for EU visitors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GA4 does not load until user explicitly accepts
- [ ] Error monitoring (Sentry) respects consent or runs under documented legitimate-interest config
- [ ] Consent preference persists across page loads via `localStorage('cookie-consent')`
- [ ] Banner does not appear for returning users who have already chosen
- [ ] "Cookie Preferences" link in footer allows changing choice
- [ ] Privacy policy (`src/pages/privacy.astro`) reflects the consent mechanism
- [ ] Consent banner passes WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility audit (axe-core)

#### Technical Context

- Create `src/components/CookieConsent.astro` — minimal banner in `BaseLayout.astro` (after Header, before main content), two buttons (Accept/Decline), built with existing design system (`.brutal-btn`, frosted glass, CSS variables)
- Gate GA4 via Consent Mode API: `gtag('consent', 'default', { analytics_storage: 'denied' })` on load, update to `'granted'` on acceptance. Modify `src/components/GoogleAnalytics.astro`
- Gate Sentry: modify error tracking component to respect consent, or confirm Sentry's privacy-first config (no PII, errors only) qualifies for legitimate interest
- Add "Cookie Preferences" link in `src/components/Footer.astro` to re-open the banner
- Update `src/pages/privacy.astro` cookie section with consent disclosure
- Custom implementation preferred over external libraries (Klaro, Osano) — site uses one tracking tool plus error monitoring; lightweight component is simpler
- Tests: unit (GA4 gating, persistence), E2E (banner flow), axe-core (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Business Capabilities

### BL-004: Email Capture System

**Source**: BUSINESS_ENABLEMENT_V1.md | **Effort**: 2 days | **Status**: Open

**As a** site operator, **I want** an email signup form in the footer **so that** prospects who aren't ready to book a call can express interest and I can build a contact database over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Email signup form visible in footer on all pages
- [ ] Successful submissions recorded in chosen email service
- [ ] GA4 `email_signup` event fires on signup (only when consent granted — depends on BL-001)
- [ ] Privacy policy updated with email collection disclosure
- [ ] Form handles error states gracefully (network failure, API error, validation error)
- [ ] Zero PII stored in client-side code or localStorage
- [ ] Form passes WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility audit

#### Technical Context

- **Prerequisite**: BL-001 (Cookie Consent) must be implemented first — signup tracking must be consent-gated
- Choose email service: evaluate Mailchimp, ConvertKit, Buttondown, or Resend. Criteria: free tier for low volume, API-based submission (no iframes), GDPR-compliant, simple POST endpoint
- Create `src/components/EmailSignup.astro` — minimal form (email input + submit + privacy link), scoped style using design system, inline `<script>` for `fetch()` submission, states: default/submitting/success/error
- Integrate into `src/components/Footer.astro` below existing links. Brief copy, one line
- Evaluate optional placement in `src/components/CTASection.astro` as secondary action alongside CalendarBridge
- Email validation via Zod or simple regex client-side
- Tests: unit (validation, API payload), E2E (footer form, error states), axe-core (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### BL-005: BIMI Logo Deployment (Stages 2-3)

**Source**: BIMI_VISUAL_TRUST.md | **Effort**: 30 min code + DNS propagation | **Status**: Open

**As a** site operator, **I want** the GST delta icon displayed as the sender avatar in Gmail, Apple Mail, and Yahoo Mail **so that** recipients see a verified brand identity before opening advisory emails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `public/branding/logo-bimi.svg` created in SVG Tiny PS profile (1:1 square, `version="1.2"`, `baseProfile="tiny-ps"`, no `<script>`/`<style>`, under 32KB)
- [ ] `vercel.json` updated with `Content-Type: image/svg+xml` header for `/branding/logo-bimi.svg`
- [ ] `curl -I https://globalstrategic.tech/branding/logo-bimi.svg` returns HTTP 200 with correct Content-Type, no redirects
- [ ] BIMI TXT record added in Cloudflare: `default._bimi` -> `v=BIMI1; l=https://globalstrategic.tech/branding/logo-bimi.svg; a=;`
- [ ] BIMI Inspector validation passes
- [ ] Test email to Gmail shows logo in inbox

#### Technical Context

- Stage 1 (DNS hardening) already complete: DMARC `p=quarantine; pct=100`, SPF `-all`, DKIM active
- Source logo: `public/images/logo/gst-delta-icon-teal-stroke-thick.svg` (64x64, ~300 bytes)
- Conversion: scale to 512x512, add solid background (#0a0a0a) for mail client rendering, set SVG Tiny PS attributes
- DNS record is a manual step in Cloudflare (1-48h propagation)
- Validation tools: bimigroup.org/bimi-generator, mxtoolbox.com/bimi.aspx

### BL-006: BIMI CMC Certificate

**Source**: BIMI_VISUAL_TRUST.md | **Effort**: Purchase + config | **Status**: Deferred

**As a** site operator, **I want** a Common Mark Certificate (CMC) for BIMI **so that** the logo display is cryptographically verified and more mail clients render it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CMC certificate purchased from DigiCert or Entrust (~$100-300/year)
- [ ] Certificate hosted at stable HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://globalstrategic.tech/branding/gst-bimi.pem`)
- [ ] BIMI DNS record `a=` tag updated with certificate URL

#### Technical Context

- Requires 12 months of logo usage history as proof
- Updates the existing BIMI DNS record from BL-005 — adds certificate URL to the `a=` field
- Delivers 90% of the value without a trademark — logo displays in inboxes

---

### BL-007: BIMI VMC Upgrade and USPTO Trademark

**Source**: BIMI_VISUAL_TRUST.md | **Effort**: 8-12 months (trademark) + ~$1,500/year (VMC) | **Status**: Deferred

**As a** site operator, **I want** a Verified Mark Certificate (VMC) with a registered trademark **so that** the GST delta icon appears with a Gmail blue verified checkmark.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] USPTO trademark filed for GST delta icon ($250-350/class, Class 35 and/or Class 42)
- [ ] After trademark registration: VMC certificate purchased (~$1,500/year)
- [ ] BIMI DNS record updated with VMC certificate URL
- [ ] Gmail displays blue verified checkmark alongside logo

#### Technical Context

- USPTO timeline: 8-12 months from filing to registration
- Process: file application -> examiner reviews (3-4 months) -> published for opposition (30 days) -> registration issued
- Requires proof the mark is in use in commerce (website screenshots, client communications)
- Self-filing via teas.uspto.gov possible; attorney recommended ($500-1,500 for simple filing)
- Same infrastructure as BL-005/BL-006, different CA verification level

---

## CSS and Design System

### BL-020: Design System Package Extraction

**Source**: DESIGN_SYSTEM_FUTURE_INITIATIVES.md | **Effort**: Large | **Status**: Deferred

**As a** developer working on a second GST project, **I want** the design system extracted into a standalone npm package **so that** multiple projects can share the same design language with versioned releases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Design system CSS, tokens, and component classes packaged as standalone npm module
- [ ] Current site imports from the package with zero visual regression
- [ ] Versioned releases aid multi-developer coordination

#### Technical Context

- **Deferred indefinitely** — no current need. Re-evaluate when: a second project needs the same design language, the design system stabilizes, or the team grows beyond one person
- Single consumer (GST website only), no monorepo infrastructure exists
- Current architecture is already clean (single import through BaseLayout)
- Prerequisite: global.css split (BL-021, complete) already done

---

## Infrastructure

### BL-031: MCP Server — Internal Prototype (Phase 1)

**Source**: MCP_SERVER_INITIATIVE.md (archived) | **Architecture & plan**: [MCP_SERVER_ARCHITECTURE_BL-031.md](MCP_SERVER_ARCHITECTURE_BL-031.md) ([test-completion companion](MCP_SERVER_ARCHITECTURE_BL-031_tests.md)) | **Effort**: 1-2 days | **Status**: Complete — local stdio MCP server shipped with three tools (`generate_diligence_agenda`, `search_portfolio`, `list_portfolio_facets`); engine parity verified end-to-end, invalid-input rejection clean, in-process protocol-roundtrip integration tests in CI, recorded smoke evidence in workspace README (April 27, 2026).

**As a** GST team member, **I want** a local MCP server exposing the diligence engine and portfolio search **so that** I can query GST's tools from Claude Desktop and Claude Code without opening the website.

> **Implementation plan**: see [MCP_SERVER_ARCHITECTURE_BL-031.md](MCP_SERVER_ARCHITECTURE_BL-031.md) — covers MCP architecture introduction, repo-placement and lifecycle decisions, the Phase 1 file layout and tool surface, and verification steps. The canonical SDK is the v2 split-package family (`@modelcontextprotocol/server` + companions); the implementation pins `@modelcontextprotocol/server@2.0.0-alpha.2` and adds `@cfworker/json-schema` directly because v2 alpha imports it unconditionally despite declaring it as an optional peer.

#### Planning Criteria

**Use cases**

- **Live agenda drafting** — while drafting a client proposal in Claude Desktop, ask the model to generate a tailored diligence agenda for a specific deal (`{ transactionType: 'majority-stake', productType: 'b2b-saas', techArchetype: 'modern-cloud-native', ... }`); the topic list streams into the same conversation that's writing the proposal
- **Comparable-deal recall** — mid-call with a prospect, query `search_portfolio { search: 'CRM', engagement: 'Value Creation' }` to pull relevant past engagements for analogical anchoring
- **Internal experimentation** — exercise the engines as agent tools to find ergonomics issues (oversized payloads, ambiguous enums, missing facets) before any external client sees them
- **Onboarding & training** — a new analyst can query the diligence engine through Claude to learn the wizard's logic without the visual scaffolding getting in the way
- **Test-bed for BL-032** — proves the tool registry / Zod-schema bridging pattern that the remote phases will inherit

**Outcomes**

- Server installed locally by every GST team member with Claude Desktop or Claude Code (target: 100% adoption within the first week)
- Used ≥5 times per week per active team member for two consecutive weeks without anyone reaching for `localhost:4321/hub/tools/diligence-machine` instead
- Zero behavior divergence reports — every output the MCP server returns matches what the website wizard would produce for the same inputs
- Foundation validated: tool registry decoupled from transport such that BL-032 only swaps the transport layer

**Business value**

- **Time saved**: ~10–15 min per agenda drafting session by eliminating the browser context switch and manual transcription of wizard output into client-facing artifacts
- **Risk reduction for BL-032/BL-033**: API ergonomics, schema gaps, and edge cases surface in low-stakes internal use rather than during a paid pilot
- **Concrete artifact for narrative**: gives investor conversations and partner pitches something real to point at when describing GST's "AI-native advisory" positioning — moves the claim from aspirational to demonstrated
- **Zero incremental cost**: uses existing infrastructure (no new SaaS, no new runtime dependencies beyond `@modelcontextprotocol/server` + the `@cfworker/json-schema` peer it requires) — this is a 1-2 day spend that unlocks the rest of the MCP roadmap

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Server scaffolding**

- [x] New workspace directory `mcp-server/` at repo root with its own `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `README.md` — does NOT touch the Astro build
- [x] Built with `@modelcontextprotocol/server` (v2 split-package family; v2.0.0-alpha at the time of this work) using stdio transport — no HTTP, no auth
- [x] Single entry point `mcp-server/src/index.ts` bundled to `mcp-server/dist/index.js` (`tsc --noEmit` for typecheck + `esbuild` for the bundle, since the website source uses extensionless imports that vanilla `tsc --moduleResolution NodeNext` can't run); `npm run build` produces a runnable binary
- [x] Binary declared via `bin` field in `mcp-server/package.json` so it can be invoked as `node /abs/path/to/dist/index.js` from a Claude Desktop / Claude Code config block
- [x] Tool input schemas declared with **Zod** (already a project dependency) and converted to JSON Schema for MCP via `zod-to-json-schema` or the SDK's helper

**Tools exposed**

- [x] `generate_diligence_agenda` — wraps `generateScript(inputs)` from [src/utils/diligence-engine.ts](../../utils/diligence-engine.ts)
  - Input schema mirrors `UserInputs` (13 fields: transactionType, productType, techArchetype, headcount, revenueRange, growthStage, companyAge, geographies[], businessModel, scaleIntensity, transformationState, dataSensitivity, operatingModel)
  - Enum values for each field sourced from [src/data/diligence-machine/wizard-config.ts](../../data/diligence-machine/wizard-config.ts) so the schema stays in lockstep with the website wizard
  - Returns the full `GeneratedScript` (topics, attentionAreas, triggerMap, metadata) as MCP `text` content, JSON-stringified
  - Returns a structured MCP error (not a thrown exception) when input fails Zod validation
- [x] `search_portfolio` — wraps `filterProjects(projects, criteria)` from [src/utils/filterLogic.ts](../../utils/filterLogic.ts)
  - Bundles `src/data/ma-portfolio/projects.json` (61 projects) at build time via esbuild's JSON loader, validated at module init against the existing Zod schema in `src/schemas/portfolio.ts`
  - Input schema: `{ search?: string, theme?: string, engagement?: string, limit?: number (default 20, max 61) }` — defaults `theme`/`engagement` to `'all'` to match `FilterCriteria` semantics
  - Returns array of matched `Project` objects plus a count summary
  - Optional companion tool `list_portfolio_facets` returning `{ themes: string[], engagementCategories: string[], growthStages: string[], years: number[] }` from the existing `getUnique*` helpers — saves callers a roundtrip when discovering filter values

**Verification & docs**

- [x] `mcp-server/README.md` documents: install/build steps, JSON config snippets for both Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`) and Claude Code (`.mcp.json` or `~/.claude/settings.json` `mcpServers` entry), each tool's input schema with one concrete example invocation
- [x] Vitest unit tests for the tool handlers using the SDK's in-memory test transport — cover happy path, invalid input rejection, and empty-result cases for both tools (24 unit + 9 in-process protocol-roundtrip integration tests via vendored `PairedTransport` — see [MCP_SERVER_ARCHITECTURE_BL-031_tests.md](MCP_SERVER_ARCHITECTURE_BL-031_tests.md))
- [x] Manual smoke test recorded in the README: launch the server, invoke `generate_diligence_agenda` from Claude Desktop with the example payload, confirm a non-empty topic list comes back
- [x] Repo-root `npm run lint` and `npx astro check` continue to pass (the new directory is excluded from Astro's tsconfig but still linted by the existing flat ESLint config)

#### Technical Context

**Why this is small**

- The two engines are already pure, fully typed, and unit-tested — `generateScript` has zero DOM/Astro/runtime coupling, and `filterProjects` operates on plain JSON. The MCP wrapper is essentially: parse input → call function → JSON-stringify output.
- Zod is already in `dependencies`. The source-of-truth schemas in `src/schemas/` (portfolio, diligence) can be re-imported by the MCP server via a relative path, so the input shapes can never drift from what the website renders.

**File layout**

```
mcp-server/
├── package.json          # type: module, bin entry, depends on @modelcontextprotocol/server + @cfworker/json-schema + zod
├── tsconfig.json         # extends ../tsconfig.json (or standalone strict config), outDir: dist
├── README.md             # install + Claude Desktop/Code config snippets + tool examples
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts          # server bootstrap, registers tools, starts stdio transport
│   ├── tools/
│   │   ├── diligence.ts  # imports generateScript from ../../../src/utils/diligence-engine
│   │   └── portfolio.ts  # imports filterProjects + loads projects.json at module init
│   └── schemas.ts        # re-exports / adapts Zod schemas from ../../../src/schemas
└── tests/
    ├── diligence.test.ts
    └── portfolio.test.ts
```

The relative-import dance keeps the engines as the single source of truth — no copy-paste, no separate publish step.

**Out of scope for this phase** (covered by BL-032 / BL-033)

- HTTP / Streamable HTTP transport
- Authentication, rate limiting, audit logging
- Radar tools (`search_radar`, `get_latest_insights`) — defer to BL-032 since they require Inoreader credentials and rate-limit handling
- Cloudflare Worker deployment, edge networking
- OAuth, external client onboarding, MCP directory listing

**Risks & mitigations**

- **Engine drift**: if a future PR adds a field to `UserInputs` without updating the MCP schema, callers will get silent rejections. Mitigation — derive the MCP input schema from the existing Zod schema in `src/schemas/diligence.ts` rather than redefining it
- **Dataset growth**: `projects.json` is loaded once at boot; this is fine at 61 projects but the README should call out that growth past ~1000 records would warrant a streaming or paginated response
- **Path-resolution under stdio**: when Claude Desktop spawns the server its `cwd` is the user's home dir, not the repo. Resolve `projects.json` via `import.meta.url` / `fileURLToPath`, not `process.cwd()`

**Validation sequence before marking done**

1. `cd mcp-server && npm run build && npm test` — green
2. From repo root: `npm run lint && npx astro check && npm run test:run` — still green (no regression in main project)
3. Add the local server to `claude_desktop_config.json`, restart Claude Desktop, confirm tools appear in the tool list
4. Invoke each tool with the README's example payload, confirm a sensible response
5. Invoke `generate_diligence_agenda` with a deliberately invalid `transactionType` (e.g. `"foo"`), confirm a clean MCP error rather than a stack trace

### BL-031.5: MCP Server — Hub Surface Extension

**Source**: BL-031.5 — extends Phase 1 surface | **Architecture & plan**: [MCP_SERVER_HUB_SURFACE_BL-031_5.md](MCP_SERVER_HUB_SURFACE_BL-031_5.md) | **Effort**: 3-5 days | **Status**: Complete (April 28, 2026) | **Depends on**: BL-031

**As a** GST team member, **I want** the local MCP server to also expose the remaining Hub tool engines (ICG, TechPar, Tech Debt, Regulatory Map) and to expose the Library articles and the Radar snapshot as MCP **Resources** **so that** my agents can pull GST's full advisory toolkit and reference content into any conversation without opening the website.

> **Implementation plan**: see [MCP_SERVER_HUB_SURFACE_BL-031_5.md](MCP_SERVER_HUB_SURFACE_BL-031_5.md) — covers the MCP "Resources" primitive, the Tool/Resource taxonomy across the Hub surface, content-source decisions for Library articles, the Radar-snapshot constraint that protects the Inoreader 200 req/day budget, and verification steps.

#### Planning Criteria

**Use cases**

- **Cost-governance assessment in-flow** — while drafting an ICG memo for a target, ask the model to score the company's cost maturity (`assess_infrastructure_cost_governance { answers: {...}, stage: 'scaling' }`) and produce a prioritized remediation list inline; eliminates the wizard round-trip
- **TechPar benchmarking mid-conversation** — drop a target's spend breakdown into a chat (`compute_techpar { arr: 25_000_000, stage: 'expansion', ... }`) and get the blended cost ratio + 36-month trajectory back without leaving the document
- **Tech-debt sizing on the call** — during a CTO conversation, estimate the carrying cost of legacy maintenance (`estimate_tech_debt_cost { teamSize, salary, maintenanceBurdenPct }`) for a defensible figure to anchor the discussion
- **Regulatory framework as native context** — pin `gst://regulations/eu/gdpr` or `gst://regulations/us/ca/ccpa` into a deal-review conversation; the model treats it as referenceable context rather than re-typed quotes
- **Library article reuse** — pull the **VDR Structure Guide** (`gst://library/vdr-structure`) into a client-prep conversation as a single resource the model can read and adapt without us re-explaining it
- **Radar context for prep work** — read `gst://radar/fyi/latest` from the local snapshot to surface the most recent annotated items before a partner call (offline-safe; no Inoreader calls)
- **Proof-of-concept for Resources primitive** — exercises the read-only Resource handler pattern that BL-032 (radar live) and BL-033 (per-client regulatory access) will inherit

**Outcomes**

- Tool parity: `assess_infrastructure_cost_governance`, `compute_techpar`, `estimate_tech_debt_cost`, `search_regulations`, `list_regulation_facets`, and `search_radar_cache` all installed locally by every GST team member alongside the BL-031 tools
- Resource exposure: Library × 2, Regulations × 120+, Radar Wire/FYI streams visible in Claude Desktop's resource picker; at least one team member uses a pinned Library or Regulation URI in a real client-prep conversation within the first two weeks
- Zero Inoreader API calls attributable to MCP traffic — the local snapshot pattern (`npm run radar:seed`) holds; verified by absence of 4xx/5xx Inoreader log entries in the seed window
- URI stability invariant: a frozen Vitest-asserted manifest of expected resource URIs prevents accidental contract breakage
- Foundation validated: hybrid Tool+Resource pattern proven locally before BL-032 layers HTTP transport on top

**Business value**

- **Multiplies the BL-031 productivity win** — the Hub has 5 tools; BL-031 covers 1; BL-031.5 brings the other 4 into the same conversational surface
- **De-risks BL-032's hybrid surface** — Resources are not just a "nice extra"; they are the right primitive for regulatory, library, and per-item radar exposure. Validating the URI scheme + freshness semantics now (locally, low-stakes) is the cheapest place to learn the ergonomics
- **Concrete differentiator for narrative** — "agents can pin GST's regulatory library and TechPar engine as native context" reads materially stronger than "agents can call our diligence tool"
- **Marginal cost** — same workspace, same SDK, same CI; the 3-5 day estimate covers four engine wrappers, the Resources registry, library-content sourcing, and the snapshot-based radar handler

#### Acceptance Criteria

**New tools (extend BL-031's tool registry)**

- [x] `assess_infrastructure_cost_governance` — wraps the ICG engine; input includes the `answers` map and an optional `companyStage`; output is `{ overallScore, maturityLevel, domainScores[], showFoundationalFlag, recommendations[], answeredCount, totalQuestions, skippedCount }`. Field names are canonical to the engine; full reference in [`mcp-server/src/docs/icg/CONTRACT.md`](../../../mcp-server/src/docs/icg/CONTRACT.md)
- [x] `compute_techpar` — wraps the TechPar engine; input is `TechParInputs` (14 fields); output is `TechParResult`. Full reference in [`mcp-server/src/docs/techpar/CONTRACT.md`](../../../mcp-server/src/docs/techpar/CONTRACT.md)
- [x] `estimate_tech_debt_cost` — wraps the Tech Debt engine; **input MUST be raw values** (team size, salary, maintenance burden, deploy frequency, etc.) — slider-position helpers stay on the website side. Full reference in [`mcp-server/src/docs/tech-debt/CONTRACT.md`](../../../mcp-server/src/docs/tech-debt/CONTRACT.md)
- [x] `search_regulations` — facet/search across the regulatory-map JSON files; input `{ jurisdiction?, category?, query?, limit? }`; output includes the resource `uri` for each matched framework. Full reference in [`mcp-server/src/docs/regulatory-map/CONTRACT.md`](../../../mcp-server/src/docs/regulatory-map/CONTRACT.md)
- [x] `list_regulation_facets` — companion enumerator for `{ jurisdictions[], categories[], totalFrameworks }`
- [x] `search_radar_cache` — local-only equivalent of BL-032's `search_radar`; reads from the seed snapshot ONLY; explicitly named to avoid future collision with the live remote tool

**Resources primitive (new for this initiative)**

- [x] MCP server registers `resources/list` and `resources/read` handlers
- [x] Library: `gst://library/business-architectures` and `gst://library/vdr-structure`, `mimeType: text/markdown`, body sourced from a single canonical location ([deviation](MCP_SERVER_HUB_SURFACE_BL-031_5.md#deviation--library-content-source-bl-0315): heavily-componentized Astro pages led to parallel-canonical `.md` digests at `src/data/library/<slug>/article.md` rather than an Astro content-collection migration; live website page is authoritative if drift)
- [x] Regulations: one Resource per framework, URI `gst://regulations/<jurisdiction>/<framework-id>`, `mimeType: application/json` (full JSON body returned as text)
- [x] Radar: `gst://radar/fyi/latest`, `gst://radar/wire/latest`, `gst://radar/wire/<category>` (one per category) — resource description includes `lastSeededAt`; if seed snapshot is missing, the Resource returns a structured "run `npm run radar:seed`" message. Per-item URIs (`gst://radar/item/<id>`) deferred — `search_radar_cache` returns items directly so callers don't need to chain into a per-item Resource
- [x] **No live Inoreader calls** from any radar-related tool or resource — enforced by a scoped ESLint `no-restricted-imports` rule that prevents `mcp-server/src/` from importing `src/lib/inoreader/client.ts`
- [x] Resource URI manifest frozen as a Vitest test (`mcp-server/tests/integration/resource-uri-stability.test.ts`); deliberate URI changes require updating the manifest AND bumping `mcp-server/package.json` version

**Verification & docs**

- [x] [MCP_SERVER_HUB_SURFACE_BL-031_5.md](MCP_SERVER_HUB_SURFACE_BL-031_5.md) updated with any deviations made during implementation (Library content-source decision section appended)
- [x] `mcp-server/README.md` extended with the new tool and resource catalog plus a "How Resources work in this server" section
- [x] Vitest tests for each new tool (parity test against the corresponding website engine) and each Resource shape (URI parsing, body retrieval, missing-snapshot graceful failure) — 93 tests total, was 33
- [x] Manual parity check recorded in the README — `Last verified (BL-031.5 surface): April 28, 2026` stanza covers all 6 new tools + 3 Resource families with concrete output values
- [x] Repo-root `npx astro check && npm run lint && npm run lint:css && npm run test:run` continues to pass

#### Technical Context

**Tool/Resource fit summary**

| Surface                 | Primitive | URI / Tool name                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ICG, TechPar, Tech Debt | Tool      | `assess_infrastructure_cost_governance`, `compute_techpar`, `estimate_tech_debt_cost` |
| Regulatory Map          | Hybrid    | Tool: `search_regulations`; Resource: `gst://regulations/<j>/<id>`                    |
| Library                 | Resource  | `gst://library/<slug>`                                                                |
| Radar (cached)          | Hybrid    | Tool: `search_radar_cache`; Resources: `gst://radar/...`                              |

**Why this is its own initiative (not folded into BL-031)**

- BL-031 is "wrap two pure functions, prove the path, ship in 1-2 days" — small enough to validate the engineering decisions cheaply
- BL-031.5 introduces a new MCP primitive (Resources), four new engine wrappers, content-source decisions for the Library, and the radar-snapshot constraint — each of which has its own design call
- Splitting them lets BL-031 ship and start delivering value while BL-031.5 absorbs the design questions on its own timeline

**Key constraint — Inoreader budget protection**

The local MCP server MUST NOT make Inoreader API calls. The 200 req/day budget is shared with the website's ISR (~28 calls/day) and BL-032's planned remote rate-limit logic. An always-on local MCP server fetching live data would burn the budget within hours. The server reads the snapshot produced by `npm run radar:seed` (already documented in [RADAR.md](../hub/RADAR.md)) and returns a structured "snapshot missing" error if the file is absent.

**Out of scope** (covered by BL-032 / BL-033)

- Live radar fetching, HTTP transport, OAuth, rate limiting, audit logs — all unchanged from the BL-031 deferral list
- A "write" tool surface (the MCP server stays read-only)
- MCP Prompts primitive
- Per-client / per-tier resource access controls (BL-033)

### BL-031.75: MCP Server — Consultant Prompt Library

**Source**: BL-031.75 — extends Phase 1 surface with Prompts | **Architecture & plan**: [MCP_SERVER_PROMPTS_BL-031_75.md](MCP_SERVER_PROMPTS_BL-031_75.md) | **Effort**: 2-3 days engineering + senior-consultant review time | **Status**: Open | **Depends on**: BL-031, BL-031.5

**As a** GST analyst (or onboarding new hire), **I want** GST's repeatable consultant workflows packaged as named slash-command prompts in Claude Desktop **so that** I can invoke "/gst_diligence_kickoff" or "/gst_target_quick_look" and get a templated, GST-house-style brief that orchestrates the right Tools and Resources without me needing to remember the recipe.

> **Implementation plan**: see [MCP_SERVER_PROMPTS_BL-031_75.md](MCP_SERVER_PROMPTS_BL-031_75.md) — covers the MCP "Prompts" primitive, the proposed prompt library and naming convention (`gst_*` prefix), the per-prompt module shape (with `version` and `lastReviewedAt` fields), the senior-consultant review gate, and verification steps.

#### Planning Criteria

**Use cases**

- **New-engagement kickoff** — `/gst_diligence_kickoff { targetName, transactionType, productType, ... }` produces a starter agenda + VDR follow-up suggestions in GST's house style; replaces the unwritten "what does a senior consultant do at engagement kickoff" tacit knowledge with a runnable template
- **Target first-look** — `/gst_target_quick_look { targetName, productType, arr, stage, hqJurisdiction }` orchestrates ICG + TechPar + Tech Debt + regulatory exposure into one digestible brief; consistent format across analysts
- **Comparable engagement memo** — `/gst_comparable_engagements_memo { targetDescription, theme? }` finds 3-5 comparable past engagements via the portfolio search, summarizes the relevant lesson from each, frames analogically
- **Regulatory exposure brief** — `/gst_regulatory_exposure_brief { targetJurisdictions[], dataCategories[], productType }` compiles applicable frameworks with summaries pulled from BL-031.5's regulation Resources
- **VDR audit** — `/gst_vdr_audit` compares a target's actual VDR contents against the canonical 10-folder taxonomy from the Library; flags gaps and surfaces follow-up requests
- **Architecture review** — `/gst_architecture_layer_review { targetSummary }` walks the target through the 5-layer architecture framework (Software → Infrastructure → Data → Org → Industry) using the Library article
- **Daily radar digest** — `/gst_radar_brief_today { category?, sinceHours? }` summarizes the most recent annotated radar items in GST Take voice from the local snapshot
- **Diligence handoff memo** — `/gst_diligence_handoff_memo { targetName, ... }` combines agenda + comparables + VDR follow-ups into a draft memo for the deal team

**Outcomes**

- Eight `gst_*` prompts visible in Claude Desktop's slash-command picker for every team member with the local MCP server installed
- New-analyst onboarding shifts from "shadow a senior consultant" to "run `/gst_target_quick_look` on three real targets and review with mentor" — measurable reduction in time-to-first-deliverable for new hires
- Each prompt has senior-consultant sign-off (gating step) confirming the output reads "as if I wrote it myself"
- Annual review cadence operational; prompts have `lastReviewedAt` tracked; CI fails if any prompt is over 12 months stale
- ≥5 prompts used per active team member per week for two consecutive weeks — proves the slash-menu is the natural entry point for GST workflows
- Foundation for paid prompt-pack offering (BL-033) validated: the same prompt module shape is portable to a per-client tier

**Business value**

- **Codifies tacit consulting judgment** — the most valuable, least-documented asset in a boutique advisory firm. Prompts become firm IP that survives consultant turnover
- **Compresses onboarding ramp time** — measured in real days saved per new hire; for a firm where consultants are the cost driver, this compounds
- **Multiplies BL-031 + BL-031.5 ROI** — Tools and Resources are useful to people who already know the workflow. Prompts make them useful to people learning it. Same engineering cost, dramatically broader audience
- **Consistency across deliverables** — when every analyst's first-look brief uses the same prompt, output quality variance collapses; clients see GST's house style every time
- **Concrete asset for narrative** — "GST has codified its diligence workflows as agent-native templates" reads materially differently from "GST has a website with tools." Pitch surface, hiring surface, investor surface all benefit
- **Cost**: 2-3 days engineering + senior-consultant review time (the latter is the binding constraint — frame as ~30 min per prompt)
- **Marginal infrastructure cost**: zero — same `mcp-server/` workspace, same SDK, same CI

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Prompts primitive (new for this initiative)**

- [ ] MCP server registers `prompts/list` and `prompts/get` handlers via the SDK's `registerPrompt` API
- [ ] All prompts use the `gst_` name prefix (avoids slash-menu collisions with other installed MCP servers); enforced by a regex check in `mcp-server/src/prompts/_registry.ts`
- [ ] Per-prompt module exports a uniform shape: `{ name, description, version, lastReviewedAt, argsSchema, build }` — see [MCP_SERVER_PROMPTS_BL-031_75.md § Per-prompt module shape](MCP_SERVER_PROMPTS_BL-031_75.md#per-prompt-module-shape)
- [ ] Argument schemas re-use (via Zod composition) the same source-of-truth schemas as the Tools the prompt orchestrates — CI test asserts no drift

**Prompt library (8 prompts)**

- [ ] `gst_diligence_kickoff` — wraps `generate_diligence_agenda` Tool + references VDR Library Resource
- [ ] `gst_target_quick_look` — orchestrates ICG + TechPar + Tech Debt + regulatory search Tools
- [ ] `gst_comparable_engagements_memo` — wraps `search_portfolio` + `list_portfolio_facets` Tools
- [ ] `gst_regulatory_exposure_brief` — wraps `search_regulations` Tool + reads regulation Resources by URI
- [ ] `gst_vdr_audit` — references `gst://library/vdr-structure` Resource (interactive: argument-less mode supported)
- [ ] `gst_architecture_layer_review` — references `gst://library/business-architectures` Resource
- [ ] `gst_radar_brief_today` — reads `gst://radar/fyi/latest` Resource (filter by category if supplied)
- [ ] `gst_diligence_handoff_memo` — orchestrates diligence + portfolio Tools + VDR Library Resource

**Verification & docs**

- [ ] [MCP_SERVER_PROMPTS_BL-031_75.md](MCP_SERVER_PROMPTS_BL-031_75.md) updated with any deviations made during implementation
- [ ] `mcp-server/README.md` extended with a "Prompts: GST consultant workflows" section listing every prompt, its arguments, an example invocation, and a sample output
- [ ] Vitest test per prompt asserting: (a) name has `gst_` prefix, (b) `argsSchema` parses a representative payload, (c) `build()` returns at least one message, (d) the message body references the expected Tool/Resource names
- [ ] Prompt-registry invariant tests: every prompt has `version`, `lastReviewedAt` ≤ 12 months old, `orchestrates` field listing each Tool/Resource it invokes — CI fails if any registered Tool/Resource is missing
- [ ] Golden-output snapshots per prompt (at least one representative invocation per prompt) — committed to `mcp-server/tests/examples/*.golden.md`; regression-tested on each Claude model upgrade
- [ ] **Senior-consultant review gate**: each prompt's output on a representative input has been reviewed and signed off by a senior team member as "this reads as if I wrote it." This is a **blocking acceptance criterion**, not a nice-to-have

#### Technical Context

**Why this is its own initiative (not folded into BL-031.5)**

- BL-031.5 is engineering work — wrapping engines, parsing regulation files, reading the radar snapshot. The competency is TypeScript + schema design
- BL-031.75 is content design — what does a senior consultant actually do step-by-step on each motion? The competency is consulting judgment, not code
- The bottleneck is senior-consultant review time, not engineering time. Splitting the initiatives prevents engineering from waiting on consulting review and vice versa

**Why the `gst_` prefix matters**

Prompts appear in Claude Desktop's slash-command picker alongside every other installed MCP server's prompts AND Claude Code's built-in slash commands. Without a prefix, `/diligence_kickoff` could collide with another server's prompt or a future Claude built-in. The `gst_` prefix is namespacing that costs four characters per name and pays for itself the first time another MCP server is installed.

**Why prompts have `version` and `lastReviewedAt`**

A prompt's behavior is determined by its message body — pure content. A senior consultant edits the body, every analyst's `/gst_diligence_kickoff` output changes silently. Tracking version + last-review-date forces deliberate review cycles and gives downstream users (BL-033 external clients, eventually) a stable contract.

**Out of scope** (covered by BL-032 / BL-033 or deferred indefinitely)

- HTTP transport / remote prompt access (BL-032)
- Per-client prompt customization (a paying client's white-labeled `/gst_diligence_kickoff`) — defer to BL-033 if requested
- Prompt usage telemetry — requires BL-032's logging surface; not applicable to local-stdio
- Localization — English only until GST signs a non-English-language engagement
- A prompt-builder UI on the website — authoring stays in `mcp-server/src/prompts/`
- Mutation prompts (write tools) — the MCP server stays read-only across all phases of BL-031.x

### BL-031.85: MCP Server — Tool Input Contracts

**Source**: BL-031.85 — formalizes input-schema documentation across the local-stdio surface | **Architecture & plan**: [MCP_SERVER_CONTRACTS_BL-031_85.md](MCP_SERVER_CONTRACTS_BL-031_85.md) | **Effort**: 1-2 days | **Status**: Open | **Depends on**: BL-031

**As a** GST team member (or external AI agent), **I want** every MCP tool's input schema documented as a first-class versioned contract — covering valid values, multi-select semantics, ordinal-bracket rules, downstream effects on engine output, and a registry index across all tools — **so that** I can compose calls correctly without reading the Zod schema, agents can introspect what they need before invoking a tool, and a future Information Request List (IRL) generator has a stable surface to consume.

> **Implementation plan**: see [MCP_SERVER_CONTRACTS_BL-031_85.md](MCP_SERVER_CONTRACTS_BL-031_85.md) — covers what an input contract is, the registry pattern (`mcp-server/src/docs/contracts/`), the per-tool spec template, the lightweight downstream-effect convention, the versioning discipline borrowed from BL-031.75, and the IRL forward-look (out of scope for this initiative).

#### Planning Criteria

**Use cases**

- **Self-service tool invocation** — a team member preparing a prompt for an analyst doesn't have to open `src/schemas/diligence.ts` to know what `transactionType` enum values are valid; the contract doc lists them with descriptions and downstream-effect notes
- **AI-agent introspection** — an agent in a long-running conversation can fetch the contract for a tool, plan its inputs, and avoid wasted invocations against invalid enum values
- **Onboarding new analysts** — the contract doc explains _why_ each input matters (e.g. "high data sensitivity surfaces the breach-liability attention area"), not just what's valid; reduces ramp time for first diligence agenda
- **Drift surveillance** — a contract version bump makes schema changes visible at PR review time; aligns with the schema-reuse risk mitigation BL-031.5 calls out
- **Foundation for IRL generator** — the contracts collectively become the input to a future tool that emits structured fill-in forms for analysts or external agents working offline; not in scope for BL-031.85, but the contracts are the substrate that makes it tractable

**Outcomes**

- Diligence Machine input contract authored at `mcp-server/src/docs/diligence/CONTRACT.md` — 13 fields, valid enums, downstream-effect summaries, hidden-semantics callouts (multi-region auto-sync, ordinal bracket comparison)
- Contracts registry at `mcp-server/src/docs/contracts/README.md` — what-is-an-input-contract narrative, table of all known Hub-tool contracts (diligence today; ICG / TechPar / Tech Debt / Regulatory Map / Portfolio listed as `⏳ BL-031.5`), ~10-line IRL forward-look
- Cross-references wired from `mcp-server/src/docs/diligence/USAGE.md`, `mcp-server/README.md` Tool Inventory, `src/schemas/diligence.ts` top-of-file comment, `src/docs/README.md` Quick Navigation
- Versioning discipline: each contract has a version + last-authored date; pattern reusable when BL-031.5 contracts are authored alongside their MCP tools
- Zero engine changes; zero schema changes; zero test changes — pure documentation initiative on top of the existing BL-031 surface

**Business value**

- **Reduces friction** for both human and AI-agent consumers of the local MCP surface — composing valid tool calls becomes self-evident from the doc, not a TS-archaeology exercise
- **De-risks BL-031.5** — when ICG / TechPar / Tech Debt / Regulatory Map ship as MCP tools, their contracts get authored alongside following the established pattern; no per-tool format invention, no drift
- **Enables BL-032+ remote consumers** — external agents pinning to a versioned contract gives the team a clean break-change semantic when remote API stability matters (BL-032.5 / BL-033)
- **Strategic asset for the IRL generator** — the contracts ARE the foundation; without them, IRL is unscoped; with them, IRL becomes a small downstream tool
- **Marginal cost**: 1-2 days of consolidation work, zero infrastructure cost, zero runtime impact

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Contracts authored**

- [ ] `mcp-server/src/docs/diligence/CONTRACT.md` — full contract for `generate_diligence_agenda`. Each of the 13 fields has: identifier, display label (from `wizard-config.ts`), subtitle, valid-values table (id / label / description), 1-3 line downstream-effect summary, cardinality / hidden semantics where relevant
- [ ] Hidden semantics documented: `geographies` multi-region auto-sync, `headcount` / `revenueRange` / `companyAge` ordinal bracket comparison via `meetsMinimumBracket`
- [ ] Versioning header: `version: v1`, `lastAuthored: 2026-04-27`, schema-source line range citation
- [ ] Source-of-truth pointers in the doc header: Zod schema file, wizard-config file, engine `CONDITION_LABELS` line range

**Contracts registry**

- [ ] `mcp-server/src/docs/contracts/README.md` exists with three sections: "What an input contract is", "Why the contract is its own artifact", "The contracts registry table"
- [ ] Registry table lists all six known Hub tools (diligence ✅ Authored, ICG / TechPar / Tech Debt / Regulatory Map / Portfolio Search as `⏳ BL-031.5` or `⏳ Backlog`); no stub files for the planned entries
- [ ] IRL forward-look section (~10 lines) explains what an Information Request List would be, that contracts make it tractable, and that IRL design is explicitly out of scope for BL-031.85

**Cross-references**

- [ ] `mcp-server/src/docs/diligence/USAGE.md` — schema-mapping table linked to the new `CONTRACT.md`
- [ ] `mcp-server/README.md` — "What's exposed" table's `Input` column links to `CONTRACT.md` for diligence; planned-contract notes for the other tools
- [ ] `src/schemas/diligence.ts` — top-of-file comment block (4-6 lines) pointing to `mcp-server/src/docs/diligence/CONTRACT.md` as the human-readable reference. No schema changes.
- [ ] `src/docs/README.md` — Quick Navigation row "Understand a Hub tool's input contract" → `mcp-server/src/docs/contracts/README.md`

**Verification & docs**

- [ ] [MCP_SERVER_CONTRACTS_BL-031_85.md](MCP_SERVER_CONTRACTS_BL-031_85.md) updated with any deviations made during implementation
- [ ] Cross-check: every option ID in `CONTRACT.md` matches the corresponding tuple in `src/schemas/diligence.ts` (`TRANSACTION_TYPE_IDS`, etc.). Zero drift expected — the doc copies from the source.
- [ ] Discoverability: from `src/docs/README.md`, a reader following links arrives at the contracts registry in ≤2 hops
- [ ] Live MCP exercise unchanged: `mcp__gst__generate_diligence_agenda` trigger-map dimension labels match the labels in `CONTRACT.md`'s field-overview table (since `CONDITION_LABELS` at runtime is canonical)

#### Technical Context

**Why this is its own initiative (not folded into BL-031 / BL-031.5 / BL-031.75)**

- BL-031 is "wrap two pure functions, prove the path" — small enough to validate the engineering decisions cheaply. Adding a documentation layer on top would have inflated the scope; better to ship BL-031, exercise it, then formalize.
- BL-031.5 is engineering work — wrapping additional engines, parsing regulation files, reading the radar snapshot. Schema reuse is in its risk-mitigation list (CI tests prevent drift) but human-readable contract authoring is a separate competency.
- BL-031.75 is content-design work — what does a senior consultant actually do step-by-step on each motion? Different competency from "what does the input schema mean for downstream output?"
- BL-031.85 is consolidation + technical writing — sits between engineering and content design. Different cognitive mode; deserves its own deliverable.

**Why position between BL-031.75 and BL-032**

- Both BL-031.5 and BL-031.75 already have schema-reuse-discipline acceptance criteria built in via CI tests; contracts are the documentation layer over that runtime invariant, not a hard prerequisite
- Authoring contracts AFTER multiple Hub-tool surfaces ship (BL-031.5) gives the contract format real cross-tool variance to ground in, not speculation from a sample size of one
- Stabilizing contracts before BL-032 (HTTP transport) ensures remote consumers don't depend on inline schemas that need refactoring later — contracts become the public-API stability surface

**Why no `.describe()` calls on the Zod schemas (deferred)**

- No precedent in `src/schemas/`; would be a separate consistency pass affecting all schemas
- The markdown contract doc is sufficient documentation surface today
- Adding `.describe()` later (e.g. when a runtime tool surfaces tool descriptions to clients) is a mechanical lift; not blocking the contract doc

**Why no YAML/JSON sidecar (deferred)**

- The wizard-config TS is already structured machine-readable data
- A future IRL generator should consume the wizard-config directly, not re-parse markdown
- Avoiding a second source of truth keeps drift risk minimal; the markdown is the human surface, the TS is the machine surface

**Out of scope** (deferred to BL-031.5 or future)

- Stub contract docs for the other four Hub tools (ICG, TechPar, Tech Debt, Regulatory Map) — those get authored alongside their MCP tool wrappers in BL-031.5
- The IRL generator surface itself — schema, rendering format, UI; tracked separately if/when warranted
- A YAML/JSON sidecar duplicating the wizard-config — duplicate-source-of-truth anti-pattern
- Modifications to `questions.ts` / `attention-areas.ts` — out of scope; contract doc reads them, doesn't modify them
- Updates to existing tests; contracts are documentation, not code
- A CI test that asserts every option ID in the contract matches the Zod tuple — nice-to-have, but the runtime trigger map already enforces this implicitly (a missing option produces a different label)

### BL-032: MCP Server — Internal Remote (Phase 2)

**Source**: MCP_SERVER_INITIATIVE.md (archived) | **Effort**: 1 week | **Status**: Open | **Depends on**: BL-031

**As a** GST team member, **I want** the MCP server deployed to a remote endpoint **so that** I can access GST tools from any machine — laptop, mobile Claude apps, ephemeral CI agents — without cloning the repo or running a local process.

#### Planning Criteria

**Use cases**

- **Field consulting** — at a client site on a borrowed laptop or VDI session with no GST repo cloned, paste an `Authorization: Bearer` config snippet into Claude Desktop and instantly have the tools available
- **Mobile context** — on the Claude mobile app during a flight or commute, ask `search_radar { query: 'kubernetes', tier: 'fyi' }` to surface the latest annotated FYI items before a client meeting
- **CI / agent automation** — a GitHub Action invokes `search_portfolio` to enrich a PR description with comparable past engagements ("this refactor pattern matches Project X — see attached summary"), or to validate that a new project entry doesn't duplicate an existing one
- **Internal Slack / Discord bots** — a daily digest bot calls `get_latest_insights { limit: 5 }` and posts the highest-signal radar items to a `#intel` channel
- **Cross-team access without repo onboarding** — non-engineering staff (e.g. a sales associate) get tool access through Claude without ever installing Node, npm, or wrangler

**Outcomes**

- All GST team members onboarded within the first month — measured by ≥1 successful tool invocation per `client_id` in audit logs
- **Zero Inoreader 429 errors** attributable to MCP traffic across a 30-day window (the rate-limit + 6h-cache architecture working as designed)
- p95 latency: <500ms for non-radar tools, <2s for radar tools (cold-cache); <200ms for warm-cache radar
- Health endpoint `/health` reports 99.9% uptime over 90 days — same SLO as the marketing site
- At least one CI integration shipped (PR-enrichment, daily digest, or equivalent) — proves the "machines-as-clients" path beyond interactive use

**Business value**

- **Productivity multiplier**: removes the "I need to be at my desk with the repo cloned" constraint — tools follow the team to airports, client offices, hotel WiFi, mobile devices
- **De-risks BL-033 substantially**: the auth, rate-limiting, observability, and Inoreader-budget protection layers are battle-tested by trusted internal users before any external client touches them
- **Distribution leverage**: GST's tools become composable with every other MCP server the team uses (filesystem, GitHub, Slack, Linear, etc.) — internal workflows compound rather than living in silos
- **Infrastructure validation**: proves Cloudflare Workers + Upstash Redis as the deployment substrate before BL-033 puts a paying customer's compliance posture on the line
- **Cost**: ~$0/month for prototype volume (Workers free tier covers 100k req/day, Upstash free tier covers ~10k commands/day); ~$10/month at scale — affordable enough that "just deploy it" is the right call

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Transport & deployment**

- [ ] MCP server deployed to **Cloudflare Workers** (rationale below) at a stable subdomain such as `mcp.globalstrategic.tech`
- [ ] **Streamable HTTP transport** (not the deprecated SSE-only transport) — required for compatibility with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, mobile clients, and ChatGPT's MCP support
- [ ] Worker built with `wrangler` and `@modelcontextprotocol/server` (v2 split-package family); `mcp-server/` workspace from BL-031 grows a second entrypoint `src/worker.ts` that registers the same tools but binds them to the HTTP transport
- [ ] Tool registry is shared between stdio (BL-031) and HTTP (BL-032) entrypoints — register-once, transport-twice; CI guarantees they stay in sync
- [ ] CORS headers restricted to known MCP client origins (`claude.ai`, `chatgpt.com`, `cursor.sh`, etc.) — no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

**Authentication**

- [ ] **Bearer-token API key auth** — simplest scheme that keeps the bar above zero; OAuth deferred to BL-033
- [ ] Keys generated via `wrangler secret` (one secret per team member, named `MCP_KEY_<INITIALS>`); revocation = `wrangler secret delete`
- [ ] Server returns MCP-spec-compliant `401 Unauthorized` with `WWW-Authenticate` header when key is missing/invalid
- [ ] Key prefix logged on every request (e.g. `key=rp_...`) for attribution, full key never logged
- [ ] README documents the Claude Desktop / Claude Code config snippet including the `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header

**Rate limiting (critical — Inoreader has a 200 req/day cap)**

- [ ] Sliding-window rate limiter backed by **Upstash Redis** (already in use for radar token persistence — see [src/docs/hub/RADAR.md](../hub/RADAR.md#upstash-redis-persistence))
- [ ] Per-key limits: 60 req/min and 1000 req/day for non-radar tools; **5 req/min and 50 req/day for radar tools** (Inoreader budget is shared with the live site's ISR which already consumes ~28 calls/day)
- [ ] Global circuit breaker: if Inoreader returns 429, all radar tool calls return cached results for 6h before retrying — same window the website ISR uses
- [ ] Standard `RateLimit-*` response headers (RFC 9331) so clients can self-throttle
- [ ] Rate-limit decisions emit a structured log entry; threshold breaches surface in observability (see below)

**New tools (radar surface)**

- [ ] `search_radar` — full-text search over the unified Wire+FYI feed
  - Wraps `fetchAllStreams('GST-', N)` + `fetchAnnotatedItems(N)` from [src/lib/inoreader/client.ts](../../lib/inoreader/client.ts) and the merge logic from `src/lib/inoreader/transform.ts`
  - Input: `{ query?: string, category?: 'pe-ma' | 'enterprise-tech' | 'ai-automation' | 'security', tier?: 'wire' | 'fyi' | 'both', limit?: number (default 20, max 50), since?: ISO-8601 timestamp }`
  - Returns matched items with title, source, publishedAt, category, url, and (for FYI items) the highlight + GST Take
  - Results MUST go through the same 6h ISR-style cache as the website to share the API budget — implement via Upstash Redis with the radar client's existing `buildCacheKey()` strategy
- [ ] `get_latest_insights` — convenience wrapper returning the N most recent FYI items (the high-signal annotated tier)
  - Input: `{ limit?: number (default 10, max 30), category?: string }`
  - Returns FYI items sorted by `annotatedAt` descending — the same shape `RadarFeed.astro` renders
- [ ] Both new tools share a single Inoreader-client instance per worker invocation; tokens read from Upstash Redis using the existing token-resolution chain (in-memory → Redis → env vars)

**Observability**

- [ ] Every tool invocation logged as a structured JSON line: `{ timestamp, keyPrefix, tool, durationMs, success, errorCode? }` — no input/output payloads (those are reserved for BL-033's compliance audit log)
- [ ] Logs flow to Cloudflare's `tail`-able stream and are also pushed to Sentry (already configured for the site — see [src/docs/development/SENTRY_MANUAL_SETUP.md](./SENTRY_MANUAL_SETUP.md))
- [ ] Health endpoint `GET /health` returns `{ ok: true, version, gitSha, redis: 'ok' | 'degraded', inoreader: 'ok' | 'degraded' }` — uncached, no auth required
- [ ] Wrangler `wrangler tail` documented in README for live-tailing during incidents

**Verification & docs**

- [ ] `mcp-server/README.md` extended with: Cloudflare Worker deploy command, secret-management workflow, two example client configurations (Claude Desktop with HTTP transport, Claude Code), curl-based health-check command
- [ ] Vitest test suite includes: auth happy/missing/wrong-key paths, rate-limit enforcement, radar tool end-to-end with mocked Inoreader responses (reuse `tests/e2e/fixtures/radar-mock-data.ts`)
- [ ] Worker integration test using `unstable_dev` from `wrangler` exercises the HTTP transport against the in-memory MCP test client
- [ ] `wrangler.toml` checked into `mcp-server/`; production secrets never committed
- [ ] One-week post-deploy review: pull rate-limit metrics, confirm no Inoreader 429s, confirm at least one team member used it from a non-dev machine

#### Technical Context

**Why Cloudflare Workers (not Vercel)**

- The site itself runs on Vercel; deploying the MCP server to a separate platform isolates the blast radius — an MCP outage cannot take down the website, and an MCP traffic spike cannot exhaust Vercel's bandwidth/function budget
- Workers' free tier gives 100k requests/day, which is well above any plausible team usage at this stage
- Cloudflare's Smart Placement and global edge cut latency for non-US team members
- `@upstash/redis` works identically on Workers (REST API) — zero migration cost for the rate-limit/cache layer
- Streamable HTTP transport works out-of-the-box on Workers (long-lived connections supported via `WebSocket`/`fetch` streaming)

**Why API key, not OAuth (yet)**

- Internal team of <10 — onboarding/revoking with `wrangler secret` is one command
- OAuth 2.1 is mandatory for **external** clients (BL-033) but adds an authorization-server dependency, browser-based consent UI, and PKCE flows that aren't worth building for a 5-person team
- Keys can be rotated weekly via a CI cron without changing any user-facing config — Claude Desktop's MCP config supports env-var substitution for the auth header

**Code reuse**

- The Inoreader client at `src/lib/inoreader/client.ts` is already designed for serverless invocation (no DOM, no Node-only APIs except `crypto` which is supported on Workers)
- `client.ts`'s `configOverride` parameter makes Worker-side dependency injection trivial — pass Worker-bound `KV_REST_API_URL` / `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` instead of reading from `import.meta.env`
- `src/lib/inoreader/cache.ts`'s file-based dev cache stays on the Astro side; the MCP server gets its own Redis-backed cache to avoid any filesystem dependency

**Out of scope for this phase** (covered by BL-033)

- OAuth 2.1 with PKCE — bearer-token API key is the chosen Phase 2 auth
- Per-tool scopes / fine-grained permissions
- Compliance-grade audit logging (input/output payload retention)
- Prompt-injection sanitization on tool outputs
- MCP directory listing (MCPMarket.com etc.) — still internal use only
- External-client onboarding workflow

**Risks & mitigations**

- **Inoreader API exhaustion**: agents are tireless and will burn the 200 req/day budget in minutes if uncached. Mitigation — radar tools cache aggressively (6h TTL matching website ISR) and rate-limit per-key at the Worker layer; a global circuit breaker triggers on the first 429 and serves cached responses for 6h
- **Redis quota**: Upstash free tier is 10k commands/day; rate-limit checks could blow this if traffic spikes. Mitigation — the sliding-window algorithm batches reads/writes in a single Redis pipeline (≤2 commands per check); upgrade to paid tier ($10/mo) if usage exceeds 5k/day for two weeks running
- **Schema drift between stdio and HTTP entrypoints**: same tool, two transports. Mitigation — single tool registry in `mcp-server/src/tools/`, both `index.ts` (stdio) and `worker.ts` (HTTP) import from it; CI test asserts both entrypoints export the same tool names + input schemas
- **Token leakage via logs**: a careless `console.log(request.headers)` would dump bearer keys to Cloudflare logs. Mitigation — a request-scoped logger that strips `Authorization` and `Cookie` headers before any log call; lint rule (`no-restricted-syntax`) blocks raw `console.log` in worker code
- **CORS over-permissioning**: a wildcard CORS policy would let any website read MCP responses on a user's behalf. Mitigation — explicit allowlist of MCP-client origins, reviewed quarterly

**Validation sequence before marking done**

1. `cd mcp-server && npm test` — green (includes new auth + rate-limit + radar tool tests)
2. `wrangler deploy --env staging` — Worker deploys without errors
3. `curl https://mcp-staging.globalstrategic.tech/health` returns `{ ok: true, ... }` with both Redis and Inoreader checks passing
4. `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <key>" ...` against the streamable HTTP transport returns the tool list including the two new radar tools
5. From Claude Desktop pointed at staging: invoke `search_radar { query: "kubernetes" }`, confirm results return in <2s and a corresponding log entry appears in `wrangler tail`
6. Hammer the staging endpoint with 100 requests in 60s → confirm rate limiter returns 429 with `RateLimit-*` headers after the threshold
7. `wrangler deploy --env production` only after all six steps pass on staging

### BL-032.5: MCP Server — Resources & Prompts on Remote

**Source**: BL-032.5 — extends Phase 2 surface | **Architecture & plan**: [MCP_SERVER_REMOTE_RESOURCES_PROMPTS_BL-032_5.md](MCP_SERVER_REMOTE_RESOURCES_PROMPTS_BL-032_5.md) | **Effort**: 3-5 days | **Status**: Open | **Depends on**: BL-031.5, BL-031.75, BL-032

**As a** GST team member at a client site / on the Claude mobile app / on a borrowed laptop, **I want** the Library articles, regulatory frameworks, radar snapshot Resources, and consultant Prompts (`gst_*`) to be reachable over the same remote HTTP endpoint as BL-032's Tools **so that** the orchestration value of BL-031.75 doesn't evaporate the moment I leave my dev machine.

> **Implementation plan**: see [MCP_SERVER_REMOTE_RESOURCES_PROMPTS_BL-032_5.md](MCP_SERVER_REMOTE_RESOURCES_PROMPTS_BL-032_5.md) — covers HTTP caching semantics for Resources (per-Resource freshness strategy), Prompt fan-out under per-key rate limits, the scope catalog (forward-compatible with BL-033's OAuth), URI-stability discipline across the local→remote boundary, and periodic radar snapshot refresh via Worker Cron.

#### Planning Criteria

**Use cases**

- **Mobile prep before a partner call** — on Claude mobile, pin `gst://library/vdr-structure` into the conversation and read the canonical 10-folder taxonomy without opening a laptop
- **Field consulting with no repo access** — at a client site on a borrowed device, invoke `/gst_target_quick_look` and get the four-Tool orchestration over HTTP exactly as it works locally
- **Regulatory review with cross-jurisdictional pinning** — pin `gst://regulations/eu/gdpr` and `gst://regulations/us/ca/ccpa` into a deal-review conversation; both resolve over HTTP with identical content to the local version
- **Scope-gated radar access** — issue a bearer key without `resource:radar:read` to a sales-associate teammate who shouldn't see the GST Take voice; their MCP client lists Tools and Library Resources but no radar Resources
- **Pinned conversations survive client moves** — a consultant pinning `gst://library/business-architectures` on Monday's local server uses the same URI on Tuesday's remote server without re-pinning; URI-stability test enforces this

**Outcomes**

- All Resources and Prompts from BL-031.5 / BL-031.75 reachable via the BL-032 remote endpoint with parity to local-stdio behavior; URI-stability test asserts byte-identical resource manifests across both transports
- Radar snapshot refreshed hourly via Worker Cron (~24 Inoreader calls/day from the 200/day budget) — total budget consumption (Cron + ISR + per-key rate-limited Tools) stays under the documented envelope
- HTTP cache hit rate ≥80% on Library and Regulation Resources after one week (most reads served from Upstash without invoking the handler) — measured via the observability initiative (BL-032.75)
- Zero Inoreader 429 errors over the first 30 days post-deploy — the layered rate limit + Cron + budget hard-cap holds
- Per-key scope checks pass: a key without `resource:radar:read` returns `403 Forbidden` for radar URIs with a structured error
- Prompt fan-out budget verified: `gst_target_quick_look` (4 Tools) lands inside the per-key burst allowance from a fresh-quota state

**Business value**

- **Removes the "have to be at my desk" constraint** for the full surface, not just Tools — completing the productivity multiplier BL-032 starts
- **De-risks BL-033 substantially** — the scope catalog, URI stability discipline, and HTTP caching layer are all production-tested by trusted internal users before any external pilot client touches them
- **Validates the per-Resource caching strategy** — Library / Regulations have radically different freshness semantics from Radar; getting the cache headers right under internal load is much cheaper than under contractual SLA
- **Establishes URI / prompt-name versioning discipline** — the `BREAKING_CHANGES.md` + version-bump pattern introduced here is exactly what BL-033 external clients will rely on as their stability contract
- **Cost**: same Cloudflare Workers / Upstash substrate as BL-032; Cron triggers are free on the Workers paid tier already justified by BL-032's volume; Resource cache writes consume a small slice of Upstash quota (~5k commands/day, well under the free-tier ceiling)

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Resources over HTTP**

- [ ] Worker registers `resources/list` and `resources/read` handlers binding to the same Resource modules as the BL-031.5 stdio entrypoint
- [ ] Per-Resource cache strategy implemented per the strategy table in [MCP_SERVER_REMOTE_RESOURCES_PROMPTS_BL-032_5.md § Resources](MCP_SERVER_REMOTE_RESOURCES_PROMPTS_BL-032_5.md#resources--the-design-questions-http-forces): Library + Regulations strong cache (24h), Radar latest weak cache (15min), Radar items strong cache (24h immutable)
- [ ] `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, and `Last-Modified` headers set per Resource; `If-None-Match` requests return `304 Not Modified` when the ETag matches
- [ ] Per-Resource scope check: bearer keys lacking the required scope receive `403 Forbidden` with a structured error and the missing-scope name
- [ ] Periodic radar snapshot refresh: Cloudflare Cron trigger every hour calls `fetchAllStreams` + `fetchAnnotatedItems`, transforms, and writes to Upstash
- [ ] Snapshot-missing path returns `503 Service Unavailable` with a structured retry hint (Cron will repopulate within the next interval)

**Prompts over HTTP**

- [ ] Worker registers `prompts/list` and `prompts/get` handlers binding to the same Prompt modules as the BL-031.75 stdio entrypoint
- [ ] `prompts/list` includes each prompt's `version` so clients can detect drift after server upgrades
- [ ] New introspection endpoint `GET /prompts/<name>/scopes` returns the prompt's required scope set (derived from its `orchestrates: [...]` field) so clients can pre-flight against their key
- [ ] Per-key burst allowance configured to accommodate the heaviest prompt fan-out (4 Tool calls in `gst_target_quick_look`) without false 429 from a fresh-quota state
- [ ] New aggregate metric `prompt_invocations_total` (incremented per `prompts/get`, independent of downstream Tool fan-out) — observable via BL-032.75 dashboards

**Scope catalog (forward-compatible with BL-033)**

- [ ] Scope strings defined per the catalog table in [MCP_SERVER_REMOTE_RESOURCES_PROMPTS_BL-032_5.md § Scope catalog](MCP_SERVER_REMOTE_RESOURCES_PROMPTS_BL-032_5.md#critical-cross-cutting-decisions): `tool:<name>`, `tool:radar:*`, `resource:library:read`, `resource:regulations:read`, `resource:radar:read`, `prompt:*`
- [ ] Scope catalog implemented in `mcp-server/src/auth/scopes.ts` as the single source of truth; BL-033 reuses these strings unchanged via OAuth tokens
- [ ] `wrangler secret`-issued internal keys carry the full scope set by default (per-key scope variation is BL-033's product surface; the infrastructure is in place here)

**URI / prompt-name stability discipline**

- [ ] URI-stability test extended to run against both stdio and HTTP transports (`unstable_dev` from `wrangler`); identical resource manifests required
- [ ] `mcp-server/BREAKING_CHANGES.md` introduced; CI test fails if a URI or prompt name changes without a corresponding entry AND a `version` bump in `mcp-server/package.json`
- [ ] On first deploy after a breaking change, server emits a `notifications/message` push to all connected clients describing the change

**Verification & docs**

- [ ] [MCP_SERVER_REMOTE_RESOURCES_PROMPTS_BL-032_5.md](MCP_SERVER_REMOTE_RESOURCES_PROMPTS_BL-032_5.md) updated with any deviations made during implementation
- [ ] `mcp-server/README.md` extended with: Resources-over-HTTP example (curl + ETag round-trip), Prompts-over-HTTP example, scope-failure example
- [ ] Vitest tests cover: cache-header correctness per Resource, scope-gating per Resource and per Prompt, snapshot-missing path returns 503 not 500, URI manifest stability across transports, breaking-change discipline
- [ ] Worker integration test using `unstable_dev` exercises a complete prompt fan-out (`gst_target_quick_look` → 4 downstream Tool calls) under a realistic per-key budget
- [ ] One-week post-deploy review: cache hit rate, Inoreader budget burn, zero 429s confirmed

#### Technical Context

**Why this is its own initiative (not folded into BL-032)**

- BL-032 is the largest milestone in the chain — Workers, auth, rate limiting, radar Tools, Sentry, CI for staging+production. Adding Resources + Prompts pushes the milestone into multi-week territory and dilutes the value-delivery cadence
- Splitting buys: BL-032 ships sooner; BL-032.5 designs against measured baselines from BL-032 in production; the Tools-vs-Resources/Prompts competency split mirrors BL-031.5/031.75's local-stdio version

**HTTP-specific design questions** (full detail in the architecture doc):

- Resources need cache headers (ETag, Last-Modified) and per-Resource freshness strategy — Library is near-immutable, Radar is hourly-fresh, Regulations are file-versioned
- Prompts trigger downstream Tool calls that hit the per-key rate limit — burst allowance configured to accommodate the heaviest documented fan-out
- URI rename = breaking change for every pinned client conversation — discipline (BREAKING_CHANGES.md + version bump + notifications/message push) introduced here

**Out of scope** (covered by BL-033 or later)

- OAuth 2.1, dynamic client registration, token introspection — bearer keys remain through BL-032.5
- Per-client scope variation (different keys = different scope sets) — infrastructure in place; product surface is BL-033
- Compliance-grade audit logging (full request/response retention, R2, hash chains) — BL-032.5 logs metadata only
- White-labeled per-client prompt customization — explicitly deferred to BL-033 or post-pilot
- Status-page integration for Resource freshness — observability initiative (BL-032.75)

### BL-032.75: MCP Server — Production Observability Maturity

**Source**: BL-032.75 — extends Phase 2 substrate | **Architecture & plan**: [MCP_SERVER_OBSERVABILITY_BL-032_75.md](MCP_SERVER_OBSERVABILITY_BL-032_75.md) | **Effort**: 1 sprint engineering + 10-14 day baselining window | **Status**: Open | **Depends on**: BL-032 (BL-032.5 strongly preferred for full surface coverage)

**As a** GST engineering lead approaching BL-033's contractual SLA commitments, **I want** SLO dashboards, alerting, and error-budget tracking against measured production baselines **so that** the SLAs we commit to in pilot legal paper are defensible operational reality, not aspirational numbers.

> **Implementation plan**: see [MCP_SERVER_OBSERVABILITY_BL-032_75.md](MCP_SERVER_OBSERVABILITY_BL-032_75.md) — covers the metrics catalog (typed emitters per Tool/Resource/Prompt), SLO definitions and burn-rate alerts, the Cloudflare Analytics Engine + Grafana Cloud + Slack/PagerDuty stack, and the three-phase implementation (instrument → baseline → dashboard+alert).

#### Planning Criteria

**Use cases**

- **Pre-incident detection** — Inoreader daily budget passes 70% by midday → ticket lands in `#mcp-alerts` so an engineer can investigate the consuming key/tool before the budget exhausts and starts serving stale radar
- **SLO defensibility for pilot SLA** — when BL-033 legal review asks "why 99.5% uptime?", point to 60 days of measured 99.6% with the burn-rate dashboards as evidence
- **Anomaly detection on key-level traffic** — one key bursts 50× normal traffic in 5 min → page fires; turns out an analyst left a runaway agent loop running. Without the alert, rate limits would silently absorb the burst until the daily budget exhausts
- **Radar snapshot freshness signal** — Cron job fails silently for 90 minutes → page fires (snapshot age >2× Cron interval); without observability, first signal would be a confused user reading stale radar
- **Daily ops digest** — every morning, all eng + senior consultants get an email summarizing yesterday's traffic by tool, top users by `key_prefix`, and any SLO breaches; team learns the system's normal shape and notices anomalies faster
- **Status page evidence** — the BL-033-required public status page reads from the same Analytics Engine source as internal dashboards, ensuring what clients see matches what eng sees

**Outcomes**

- 30+ days of production traffic data backing every SLO target before BL-033's legal review begins; targets sit at p95-baseline × 1.5 buffer, calibrated against measured reality
- All four canonical alerts (Inoreader budget, radar snapshot stale, health failing, traffic spike) wired to Slack + PagerDuty; each has been test-fired and resolved by a runbook execution
- Cache hit rate (BL-032.5 Resources) ≥80% measurable on the dashboard
- Daily Inoreader budget burn-down panel shows >20% headroom on a typical day; alert fires at 70% pre-emptively
- On-call rotation operating (single engineer initially); runbook for each alert tested at least once
- Status page (initially internal-IP-restricted) live at `https://status.mcp.globalstrategic.tech` showing per-tool availability + Inoreader budget consumption

**Business value**

- **Makes BL-033 SLA commitments defensible** — moves the pilot conversation from "we will commit to 99.5% uptime" to "we measured 99.6% over 60 days." This is the single most consequential output of the initiative for the commercial path
- **Surfaces incidents pre-customer-impact** — alerts fire on leading indicators (budget burn rate, snapshot age, anomalous traffic) rather than lagging indicators (an angry user). For a B2B advisory product, prevented incidents are worth far more than detected ones
- **Operational maturity signal** — when a PE compliance team asks "show us your monitoring," there's a real answer with screenshots. Hard to overstate how much this matters for enterprise sales
- **Foundation for capacity planning** — once measured, easy to project when Cloudflare/Upstash/Sentry tiers will need an upgrade; budget conversations have data instead of guesswork
- **Cost**: Cloudflare Analytics Engine free tier covers projected volume (~30× headroom); Grafana Cloud free tier sufficient for 3 users + 10k metric series; Slack webhook + PagerDuty starter tier ($25/mo) covers a single on-call rotation. Total ongoing: <$50/mo through pilot scale

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Phase 1 — Instrumentation**

- [ ] Typed metric emitters introduced in `mcp-server/src/metrics/` for: `tool_invocation`, `resource_read`, `prompt_invocation`, `prompt_tool_fanout`, `rate_limit_decision`, `inoreader_call`, `radar_snapshot_age`, `health_check_duration`
- [ ] Tool / Resource / Prompt registry decorators auto-emit metrics — no per-handler boilerplate; handlers stay focused on their domain logic
- [ ] Cloudflare Analytics Engine binding configured in `wrangler.toml` (`env.METRICS`); each emitter writes structured events with the dimensions documented in [MCP_SERVER_OBSERVABILITY_BL-032_75.md § Metrics](MCP_SERVER_OBSERVABILITY_BL-032_75.md#1-metrics--whats-happening-in-numbers)
- [ ] Vitest test asserts every registered Tool / Resource / Prompt emits at least one metric event in a representative invocation
- [ ] Cardinality budget per metric documented in `metrics/_index.ts`; CI test caps emission cardinality to prevent dimension explosion

**Phase 2 — Baselining**

- [ ] Instrumented build deployed to production; runs with normal team usage for ≥10 days
- [ ] Weekly traffic data extracts produce `mcp-server/observability/slo-baselines.md` documenting measured p50/p95/p99 latency and error rate per Tool / Resource / Prompt
- [ ] Initial SLO targets set at p95-baseline × 1.5 buffer; senior-engineer review and sign-off recorded in `slo-baselines.md`
- [ ] All SLO definitions captured: non-radar Tool availability, non-radar Tool latency p95, radar latency cold/warm, Resource latency, health-endpoint availability, Inoreader budget consumption, radar snapshot freshness

**Phase 3 — Dashboards & Alerts**

- [ ] `mcp-server/observability/grafana-dashboard.json` covers traffic, latency histograms, error rates, rate-limit pressure, Inoreader budget burn-down, radar snapshot age, cache hit rate
- [ ] `mcp-server/observability/alert-rules.yaml` covers every SLO from the baselining phase
- [ ] Slack webhook + PagerDuty integration wired; test-fired with a synthetic SLO breach (5% injected error rate); alert lands in correct channel within 5 min
- [ ] Runbooks authored for the four canonical alerts under `mcp-server/observability/runbooks/`: `inoreader-budget-exhausted.md`, `radar-snapshot-stale.md`, `health-check-failing.md`, `traffic-spike-detected.md`
- [ ] Status page deployed at `https://status.mcp.globalstrategic.tech` (Cloudflare Pages, signed query against Analytics Engine); initially internal-IP-restricted; BL-033 reviews and chooses what becomes externally visible
- [ ] Each runbook has a `lastReviewedAt` field; CI test fails if any runbook is over 6 months stale OR the alert that links to it has changed since last review

**Verification & docs**

- [ ] [MCP_SERVER_OBSERVABILITY_BL-032_75.md](MCP_SERVER_OBSERVABILITY_BL-032_75.md) updated with any deviations made during implementation
- [ ] `mcp-server/README.md` extended with: how to import the dashboard JSON, how to test-fire an alert, how to rotate Slack webhooks
- [ ] Two-week post-deploy review: SLO compliance, alert noise rate (target: <1 false-positive/week), dashboard usefulness (engineer survey)
- [ ] Test page through PagerDuty receives a synthetic page within 5 min; runbook link in the alert resolves to the correct markdown file

#### Technical Context

**Why this is its own initiative (not folded into BL-032 or BL-033)**

- Not BL-032: BL-032's job is to ship the remote substrate. Adding a complete observability stack pushes it into multi-week territory and risks neither piece landing
- Not BL-033: SLO baselines need real production traffic; putting observability inside BL-033 would force "guess at SLO targets, then commit them to legal paper" — exactly the sequence that produces broken contracts
- Its own initiative because: the competency is operations engineering (different from auth/audit-log focus); the work is sequenced by measured production data (a 10-14 day wait is hard to schedule inside a single milestone); the output is config-as-code (dashboards, alert rules, runbooks), not server code; the downstream value (BL-033 signs SLAs from a place of measured baselines) is concrete and worth a separately-tracked deliverable

**Stack** (full rationale in the architecture doc):

| Component      | Choice                                                                      |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Metrics store  | Cloudflare Analytics Engine (free tier, native to Workers)                  |
| Dashboards     | Grafana Cloud (free tier)                                                   |
| Alerting       | Grafana alerts → Slack webhook + PagerDuty                                  |
| Error tracking | Sentry (already wired in BL-032)                                            |
| Status page    | Cloudflare Pages, static + signed Analytics Engine query                    |
| Tracing        | Deferred (OpenTelemetry-on-Workers; revisit if a debugging case demands it) |

**Out of scope** (deferred indefinitely or to BL-033)

- Distributed tracing — value is real but adds complexity; revisit when a specific debugging case demands it
- Synthetic monitoring (external probes from multiple regions) — useful for true uptime measurement under SLA reporting; defer to BL-033
- Per-client usage dashboards (clients see their own traffic) — BL-033 product decision
- Cost observability (Cloudflare/Upstash/Sentry billing dashboards) — separate concern, low priority while spend is under $100/mo
- Audit-log integrity dashboards — that surface belongs to BL-033's compliance-grade audit log
- ML-based anomaly detection beyond simple z-score / threshold rules — premature

### BL-033: MCP Server — External Pilot (Phase 3)

**Source**: MCP_SERVER_INITIATIVE.md (archived) | **Effort**: 2 weeks engineering + indeterminate legal/sales lead time | **Status**: Open | **Depends on**: BL-032

**As a** PE firm client, **I want** to connect my AI tools to GST's MCP server **so that** my agents can query GST's diligence engine and portfolio data during deal evaluation, with the security and audit guarantees my compliance team requires.

#### Planning Criteria

**Use cases**

- **Deal-screening agent (PE deal team)** — during initial screening of a potential investment, an analyst's agent calls `generate_diligence_agenda` with the target's profile to produce a starter agenda the IC memo can be built around; saves 2–4 hours per screened deal
- **Portfolio monitoring (PE platform team)** — a daily-running agent at a portfolio-services group polls `search_radar { category: 'enterprise-tech', since: 'yesterday' }` and surfaces relevant items into the platform-wide knowledge base
- **Pitch prep (investment banker / corp dev)** — a banker prepping a sell-side pitch uses Claude with GST's MCP enabled to triangulate comparable transactions: "what GST engagements involved B2B SaaS targets between $25–100M ARR with carve-out transaction types?"
- **Vendor-evaluation agent (enterprise procurement)** — a CIO's procurement agent calls `search_portfolio` during RFP review to find GST case studies relevant to a vendor under consideration
- **Knowledge-base augmentation (research / content)** — an analyst uses GST's tools as a structured-knowledge layer alongside their own document store, blending GST's diligence framework with their proprietary deal flow data
- **Programmatic access for technical clients** — a client's internal tooling (Retool, Slack bot, custom dashboard) calls the MCP server directly, treating GST's tools as a managed API rather than a website

**Outcomes**

- **2 design-partner PE firms** in active production use within 90 days of GA launch — not just signed paper, but logs showing ≥100 tool invocations/month per client
- **Zero security incidents** over the first 6 months: no unauthorized access, no data exfiltration, no successful prompt-injection exploit found in pen test or in production
- **At least 1 pilot client converts to a paid tier** within 6 months, validating willingness-to-pay
- **Listed in ≥2 MCP directories** (Anthropic's registry + MCPMarket.com or Cursor catalog) with >50 install attempts in the first 90 days
- Audit-log integrity check passes every quarterly review for the first year (hash chain or R2 object-lock attestation)
- Pilot SLA met every month: 99.5% uptime, p95 <500ms non-radar, support response <1 business day

**Business value**

- **First product line with programmatic pricing** — moves GST beyond pure project-based advisory revenue into a recurring, per-seat or usage-priced product surface; opens a revenue stream that scales without proportional consultant time
- **Competitive moat in M&A advisory** — boutique advisory + AI-native tooling is rare; concrete differentiator for sales conversations against larger firms whose AI story is "we use ChatGPT internally"
- **Category positioning** — GST is one of the first M&A advisory firms with a public MCP server; captures inbound discovery from agent-curious PE/VC funds searching MCP directories without sales outreach
- **Diligence engine as licensable IP** — converts a website utility into a productized capability with a clear commercial story, increasing the implied valuation of the firm's intellectual property
- **Direct sales channel via MCP directories** — bypasses the traditional advisory-firm sales motion (introductions, conference networking) for technically-sophisticated buyers who self-discover and self-onboard
- **Compliance posture as moat-builder** — clients who require SEC 17a-4-grade audit logs and SOC 2 / pen-test evidence cannot easily switch to a competitor without re-doing that compliance work; the audit infrastructure built here is itself a defensible asset
- **Costs**: ~2 weeks engineering for the runtime + ongoing hosting (~$50–200/month for R2 storage, Workers paid tier, Upstash, Cloudflare Access per-user) + indeterminate legal review (NDA / DPA / SLA template — front-loaded, amortized across pilots)
- **Risk-adjusted upside**: even one Series A-tier PE client paying $2k/month covers all hosting + amortizes the engineering spend within 2 quarters; two pilot conversions clear the legal cost as well

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Authentication & authorization (OAuth 2.1)**

- [ ] OAuth 2.1 authorization server (or equivalent — see options below) with **PKCE mandatory** for all flows
- [ ] Dynamic client registration **disabled** — clients are onboarded manually as part of the pilot agreement
- [ ] Per-client `client_id` + `client_secret`, secrets stored hashed (Argon2id) in Upstash Redis with rotation supported
- [ ] **Tool-level scopes** — clients receive a scope set per tool, e.g. `tool:generate_diligence_agenda`, `tool:search_portfolio`. Radar tools require an additional `tool:radar:*` scope so radar access can be gated independently (some pilots will not include the GST Take stream)
- [ ] Access tokens are short-lived (1h) with refresh-token rotation; expired tokens return `401` with the spec-compliant `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token"` challenge
- [ ] Token introspection endpoint protected behind a separate admin scope so support engineers can debug client issues without seeing tokens
- [ ] All OAuth endpoints documented in a `.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` metadata document (RFC 8414)

**Rate limiting (per-client, contractual)**

- [ ] Per-client tier (`free-pilot` / `paid` / `enterprise`) gates the limit ceilings; tier stored in Redis client record
- [ ] Sliding-window limits applied per-tool per-client — radar tools share the global Inoreader budget circuit breaker introduced in BL-032
- [ ] Quota exhaustion returns `429` with `Retry-After` header + a structured `RateLimit-Policy` header (RFC 9331) describing the limit so client engineers can self-diagnose
- [ ] Soft-limit warning at 80% of quota emitted as an MCP-spec `notifications/message` so the calling agent can throttle itself before hitting the hard limit

**Audit logging (compliance-grade)**

- [ ] Every tool invocation written to an append-only audit log with: ISO-8601 timestamp, `client_id`, IP-prefix (truncated for GDPR — last octet zeroed), tool name, request UUID, **input parameters (full)**, **output payload size in bytes** (not the payload itself by default), durationMs, success/error code
- [ ] Optional `?audit_full_payload=true` per-client flag to retain full output payloads for clients whose compliance regime requires it (must be agreed in writing — flag flips a Redis setting)
- [ ] Logs shipped to a tamper-evident store: append-only S3 bucket with object lock, OR Cloudflare R2 with versioning + immutability — never to the same Sentry/Cloudflare logs used for ops
- [ ] Retention: minimum 7 years to satisfy SEC Rule 17a-4 (the typical PE compliance baseline); confirm exact requirement with each client in pilot agreement
- [ ] Per-client log export available via signed URL (read-only) so clients can ingest into their own SIEM
- [ ] Quarterly audit-log integrity check (hash chain or AWS Object Lock attestation) — automated, results emailed to the compliance contact

**Prompt-injection hardening**

- [ ] All free-text fields in tool outputs (project summaries, FYI GST Take, attention-area descriptions) pass through a sanitization layer that strips: zero-width characters, bidi override marks (U+202A–U+202E, U+2066–U+2069), excessive whitespace runs, and known prompt-injection sentinel phrases ("ignore previous instructions", "you are now", etc.)
- [ ] Output payloads include a top-level `_provenance: { source, sanitized: true, version }` field so calling agents can attribute content
- [ ] Maximum output size: 64KB per tool response; larger results paginate via the MCP `cursor` field. Hard cap prevents an attacker from poisoning a model's context with a giant adversarial blob
- [ ] Inputs validated against the same Zod schemas as Phase 1 PLUS a per-string length cap (no string field over 1KB) — defense in depth against schema-evading payloads
- [ ] Security review (run the built-in `/security-review` Claude Code skill on the MCP server PR, or equivalent independent review) before pilot launch — checklist follows OWASP LLM Top 10 (LLM01: Prompt Injection, LLM06: Sensitive Info Disclosure, LLM10: Model DoS)

**Pilot operations**

- [ ] **Onboarding playbook** documented: legal sign-off, NDA + DPA execution, client_id provisioning, scope assignment, sandbox environment access, joint kickoff call, success metrics
- [ ] Sandbox environment with synthetic projects.json (zero real client data) for client engineers to integrate against before touching production
- [ ] Status page published at `https://status.mcp.globalstrategic.tech` showing uptime, p50/p95 latency, and rate-limit-availability per tool
- [ ] Pilot SLA defined and contractually committed: 99.5% monthly uptime, p95 latency <500ms for non-radar tools, support response <1 business day
- [ ] At least 2 design-partner PE firms onboarded to the pilot
- [ ] Listed in **MCP directories** — submission to MCPMarket.com, Anthropic's official MCP registry, and Cursor's MCP catalog with screenshots and a 60s demo video

**Verification & docs**

- [ ] Public-facing developer docs at `https://docs.mcp.globalstrategic.tech` — tool reference (auto-generated from Zod schemas), authentication guide, rate-limit policy, audit-log schema, status page link
- [ ] Penetration test by an independent firm focused on the OAuth flow, prompt-injection surface, and audit-log integrity — findings remediated before public listing
- [ ] Load test demonstrates the system handles the contracted SLA at 10× expected pilot volume without degradation
- [ ] Final compliance review with each pilot client's information-security team — signed-off before they switch from sandbox to production tokens

#### Technical Context

**Why this is a separate phase, not an extension of BL-032**

- Phase 2 is "trusted internal users on a shared key" — security model is closed-network
- Phase 3 is "untrusted external agents acting on behalf of compliance-sensitive clients" — every assumption changes: input is hostile, audit is contractual, downtime is breach-of-contract
- Mixing the two in one milestone causes scope creep that delays both: do BL-032 first, prove the runtime, then layer hostile-environment hardening on top

**OAuth 2.1 implementation options**

| Option                                | Pros                                                                     | Cons                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build on Cloudflare Workers (custom)  | Full control, single-platform, no vendor lock-in beyond Cloudflare       | OAuth is easy to implement insecurely; takes ~1 week of careful work + security review |
| Cloudflare Access for SaaS            | Managed OAuth, integrates with Cloudflare Zero Trust, audit log built-in | Per-user pricing, less customization on scope semantics                                |
| Auth0 / WorkOS / Clerk (external IdP) | Battle-tested, dev-friendly SDKs, certified for SOC 2                    | Adds a vendor + cost; introduces a third-party dependency in the auth path             |

Recommendation: start with **Cloudflare Access for SaaS** — fastest path to a defensible auth surface, and the per-user cost is easily absorbed by pilot revenue. Re-evaluate in 6 months if scope semantics become a constraint.

**Audit-log architecture**

```
MCP Worker ──► Cloudflare Queue ──► Worker consumer ──► R2 bucket (immutable, versioned)
                                                  └──► Per-client signed URL endpoint
```

- Queue decouples request latency from log write latency (audit must be durable but must not slow the tool call)
- R2 is cheaper than S3 for the egress patterns expected here, and Cloudflare's object-lock equivalent satisfies tamper-evidence
- Hash chain: each log entry includes the SHA-256 of the previous entry, so post-hoc tampering is detectable

**Prompt-injection threat model**

The diligence engine takes structured enum inputs only — low risk. The portfolio search returns project summaries authored by GST staff — moderate risk (a malicious staff member could plant an injection, but that's an insider-threat problem outside MCP scope). The radar tools return third-party content from Inoreader — **highest risk**, since adversaries control the source. Sanitization MUST be strongest on the radar surface, weaker on the diligence/portfolio surfaces, and inputs MUST be schema-validated everywhere.

**Out of scope**

- Multi-tenant data isolation per client (each client sees the same projects.json — there's no client-specific data store yet)
- Client-supplied custom tools (write surface) — read-only by design
- Federated search across multiple GST environments
- Real-time streaming notifications (e.g. webhook on new FYI item) — defer until at least one pilot client requests it

**Risks & mitigations**

- **Compliance scope creep**: PE clients may request SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, or specific contractual indemnities. Mitigation — define a "minimum viable compliance" baseline before pilot recruitment; route requests above the baseline to a separate enterprise tier with separate pricing
- **Audit-log cost**: at high volume, log storage + egress could exceed pilot revenue. Mitigation — default retention is metadata-only (no payloads); full-payload retention is an upsell tied to a higher tier
- **OAuth-flow misconfiguration**: implementing OAuth from scratch is the most common source of CVEs in MCP-adjacent projects. Mitigation — use Cloudflare Access for SaaS or another battle-tested IdP, do not roll your own
- **Prompt-injection via radar content**: third-party article text is the highest-risk surface. Mitigation — sanitization layer + size cap + provenance metadata; document for clients that radar output should not be auto-actioned by their agents without human review
- **Pilot client churn**: PE firms have long sales cycles; pilots may stall on legal review. Mitigation — start legal review (NDA + DPA + SLA template) in parallel with engineering work, not after; have at least one warm design partner identified before kickoff
- **Reputational risk on outage**: a stale `_provenance` field or hallucinated diligence question reaching a client's investment committee is a brand event. Mitigation — sandbox-first onboarding, explicit "human in the loop" language in the developer docs, status page transparency

**Validation sequence before pilot launch**

1. All BL-032 acceptance criteria still passing in production
2. OAuth flow end-to-end tested against a real client SDK (Claude Desktop's MCP HTTP+OAuth path) — token issuance, refresh, revocation
3. Penetration test report received and all High/Critical findings remediated
4. Audit-log integrity check produces a verifiable hash chain after a synthetic 1000-event burst
5. Sandbox client successfully exercises every tool from a non-GST IP, with the corresponding audit entries visible in the per-client export
6. Two pilot agreements signed (legal + technical) — engineering does not "soft launch" without paper
7. Status page live, on-call rotation defined, incident response runbook in place
8. Public listing on at least one MCP directory with a working "try it" demo

### BL-034: MCP Server — Documentation Cleanup

**Source**: BL-034 — rolling cleanup catch-all for the MCP server doc surface | **Effort**: 0.5-1 day (executed at the end of the BL-031.x / BL-032.x / BL-033 sequence) | **Status**: Open | **Depends on**: BL-031.75, BL-032, BL-032.5, BL-032.75, BL-033

**As a** future maintainer of the GST MCP server documentation, **I want** the transitional scaffolding and accumulated cleanup items left behind by the BL-031.x / BL-032.x / BL-033 implementations consolidated into a single closing pass **so that** the doc surface stops carrying conventions that were only useful while the system was being assembled.

> **Why a catch-all**: rolling cleanup items inevitably accumulate during a multi-phase initiative — transitional precedence rules, deferred-now-tractable items, "remove me when X ships" callouts, ADR sections that have served their purpose. Tracking them in their parent initiative would inflate that initiative's AC list and risk the cleanup being skipped. Tracking them here keeps the parent initiatives focused on shipping, and gives a single place to land the "does this still need to exist?" review at the end of the MCP-server initiative sequence.

#### Planning Criteria

**Use cases**

- **Cleanup discipline**: every time a BL-031.x / BL-032.x / BL-033 initiative adds a transitional note (e.g. "remove when BL-Y closes"), add a corresponding bullet to BL-034's AC. The cleanup work itself is small; the discipline is keeping the list in sync as items emerge.
- **Convention maturation**: the BL-031.85 contracts pattern introduced "CONTRACT.md is canonical, AC describes intent". Until that convention is well-understood by reviewers, the per-tool CONTRACT.md docs and the contracts registry need explicit guardrails. Once the convention is internalized (i.e. when reviewers stop asking "is the AC or the CONTRACT.md authoritative?"), the guardrails become noise and should go.
- **ADR-vs-living-doc separation**: architectural decision records (`MCP_SERVER_ARCHITECTURE_BL-031.md`, `MCP_SERVER_HUB_SURFACE_BL-031_5.md`, `MCP_SERVER_CONTRACTS_BL-031_85.md`, etc.) freeze at authoring time and are not maintained against subsequent schema changes. Living docs (per-tool CONTRACT.md, USAGE.md, the contracts registry README) ARE maintained. BL-034's discipline is to verify, at end-of-sequence, that the right artifacts are in the right category — and that no living doc is silently inheriting prose from a frozen ADR.

**Outcomes**

- Transitional sections in `mcp-server/src/docs/contracts/README.md` removed (precedence rule + AC-authoring convention)
- Cleanup AC list below has accumulated bullets from each BL-031.x / BL-032.x / BL-033 initiative as they shipped
- A single closing PR rolls all the cleanup items together — no scope creep into other initiatives

**Business value**

- **Doc-debt prevention** — without an explicit cleanup pass, transitional scaffolding becomes permanent and confuses future maintainers
- **Convention migration** — the contracts pattern (CONTRACT.md canonical, AC conceptual) only matures if the transitional guardrails are removed at the right time; otherwise the convention is "remember to look at the canonical thing" forever, which is weaker
- **Single accountability point** — anyone reviewing the MCP server doc surface at end-of-sequence has one ticket to read, not five "what was that about" archaeology trips

#### Acceptance Criteria

**Transitional scaffolding to remove**

- [ ] `mcp-server/src/docs/contracts/README.md` § "Transitional notes (remove when BL-034 closes)" — the precedence rule and the AC-authoring convention sections — DELETED in full. The convention has either matured (no longer needed) or has been escalated into a permanent doc somewhere appropriate (in which case the redirect is the cleanup item)
- [ ] Verify no other doc references the deleted "Transitional notes" section by anchor; broken links are caught here, not in production

**ADR-vs-living-doc audit**

- [ ] Every per-tool `CONTRACT.md` cross-referenced against its Zod schema and engine source — drift caught and fixed in the contract (the contract is canonical; the schema is the source of truth)
- [ ] Every architectural-decision doc under `src/docs/development/MCP_SERVER_*.md` audited for prose that has become stale since authoring (e.g., "the planned URI manifest" when the URIs have shipped). Stale prose either edited to past tense ("the URI manifest authored under BL-031.5 is...") or deleted; ADRs are not maintained, so they should not contain present-tense claims about the codebase

**Items accumulated during prior initiatives** (append as they emerge)

- [ ] Library content-source convergence — if/when an Astro content-collection migration happens, replace the parallel-canonical `.md` digests with the unified source. Tracked here pending that decision; see [BL-031.5 deviation](MCP_SERVER_HUB_SURFACE_BL-031_5.md#deviation--library-content-source-bl-0315)
- [ ] Radar per-item URIs — `gst://radar/item/<id>` URIs were deferred in BL-031.5. Re-evaluate after BL-032 ships live data with stable item IDs; either author them as a Resource family or formally drop them from scope
- [ ] Portfolio per-tool `CONTRACT.md` and `USAGE.md` — Portfolio Search is `⏳ Backlog` in the contracts registry; if it stays that way through the MCP-server sequence, decide whether to author the docs or drop the tool from the registry
- [x] **DONE 2026-04-29**: deleted `MCP_SERVER_HUB_SURFACE_BL-031_5_Verification.md`. Recorded evidence migrated to [`mcp-server/README.md` § Smoke test](../../../mcp-server/README.md#smoke-test-manual-parity-check); UX findings logged in this BL-034 list above; doc history reachable via `git log`. The pattern (transitional punch-list doc → migrate to README → delete) is reusable for future MCP initiatives that ship code-complete with deferred verification
- [ ] **Wizard / API symmetry follow-up** (discovered during BL-031.5 V1 verification trial 1): the ICG MCP API accepts sparse `answers` maps that the website wizard cannot produce (the wizard forces an answer for every question). Documented in [`icg/CONTRACT.md`](../../../mcp-server/src/docs/icg/CONTRACT.md) hidden-semantics section as intentional asymmetry. Decide at end-of-sequence whether to (a) keep as-is and rely on the doc, (b) add an `answeredCount`-based result-confidence indicator to the API output, or (c) require the API to receive all questions (matching wizard discipline). Same audit needed for `compute_techpar` (`null` return when arr/infraHosting are 0 — wizard handles this differently) and any other tool where API and wizard input completeness rules differ
- [ ] **TechPar `exitMultiple` UX gap** (discovered during BL-031.5 V2 verification trial 1): the wizard's exit-multiple input is conditionally rendered — only visible when stage is `pe` or `enterprise` (see [`techpar-ui.ts:65-67`](../../../src/utils/techpar-ui.ts#L65-L67)). At earlier stages (Seed / Series A / Series B–C) the field is hidden, but its underlying state value persists across stage changes — meaning a user who set it to (e.g.) 15× while on Enterprise and then switched to Series B–C silently carries that 15× value into their results, the URL state, and any downstream calculations, with no UI to inspect or modify. Decide at end-of-sequence whether to (a) reset `exitMultiple` to its default when stage drops below PE, (b) show the field at all stages with stage-appropriate guidance, (c) add a "current state" inspection panel that exposes hidden values, or (d) document the behavior as intentional. Note: in scenarios where `gap.cumulative36 = 0`, the exit-multiple value has no observable output impact — but in scenarios where cumulative excess is non-zero, the silent persistence directly affects `gap.exitValue`
- [ ] **Tech Debt direct-input quantization bug** (discovered during BL-031.5 V3 verification): the wizard exposes number-input fields next to the sliders (data-direct="arr", "budget", "salary", etc.) that LOOK like free-text entry but silently quantize the user's typed value to the nearest slider position. Specifically, [`tech-debt-calculator/index.astro:1697-1714`](../../../src/pages/hub/tools/tech-debt-calculator/index.astro#L1697-L1714) — the `arr` handler does `state.arrPos = arrToPos(clamped)` and the next `render()` call computes `posToArr(state.arrPos)`, which round-trips the user's value through the slider's coarse $100K granularity (so $10,000,000 becomes $10,300,000). Same pattern for the `budget` handler ($500K becomes $522K via $1K slider granularity) and `salary` handler. The numeric input field is misleading — it suggests precision the engine can't honor through the slider domain. Decide at end-of-sequence whether to (a) make the direct inputs truly free-form by storing raw values in state and only using slider position for the slider's display, (b) add a visible "snapped to nearest slider stop" indicator after the user types, (c) increase slider granularity (more positions, finer steps), or (d) remove the number-input fields and document sliders as the only input path. Option (a) is the cleanest — it would also resolve the corresponding MCP-vs-wizard parity friction (the MCP API accepts truly raw values; matching that on the wizard side eliminates surprise)
- [ ] (Add bullets here as new transitional items emerge during BL-031.75 / BL-032 / BL-032.5 / BL-032.75 / BL-033 implementation)

**Verification & docs**

- [ ] Repo-root `npx astro check && npm run lint && npm run lint:css && npm run test:run` continues to pass after the cleanup
- [ ] `mcp-server/` workspace `npm run typecheck && npm run test && npm run build` continues to pass
- [ ] All markdown links across the MCP doc surface resolve (no 404s introduced by the cleanup)

#### Technical Context

**The discipline**

When implementing any BL-031.x / BL-032.x / BL-033 initiative:

1. If the initiative adds a transitional note (e.g., a "remove when X closes" callout), append a corresponding bullet to BL-034's AC list in the same PR. This keeps the AC list current.
2. If the initiative defers an item (e.g. "we'll author this later"), check whether it belongs here vs. its own ticket. Items that are scoped + bounded get their own ticket; items that are "see if this still matters at end-of-sequence" go here.
3. The discipline is conventional, not enforced by CI. Reviewers should ask "did this PR introduce a transitional note? if so, is it tracked under BL-034?"

**Why this is its own initiative (not folded into BL-031.85 or BL-033)**

- BL-031.85 is content-authoring work (the contracts pattern). The cleanup of _its own_ transitional scaffolding is a separate concern that depends on the convention having matured — which only happens after the convention has been used in subsequent initiatives.
- BL-033 is hardening work (OAuth, audit logs, prompt-injection sanitization). Bundling cleanup into BL-033 would risk the cleanup being skipped under hardening pressure.
- A separate ticket means a separate review gate: "does the doc surface need closing items?" is a question worth asking explicitly at the end of the sequence.

**Out of scope**

- Active doc maintenance during BL-031.x / BL-032.x / BL-033 — that's each initiative's responsibility
- Architectural decision docs are explicitly NOT in scope to be maintained — they are point-in-time records and the cleanup audits them for stale present-tense claims, not for current accuracy
- Any new feature work — BL-034 is exclusively a doc-cleanup pass

## Exploration

### BL-035: Dynamic Visual Effects Prototype

**Source**: DYNAMIC_VISUAL_EFFECTS.md | **Effort**: 2-4h prototype, 4-8h polish if approved | **Status**: Open

**As a** site visitor, **I want** subtle ambient motion in the homepage hero section **so that** the page feels alive and signals an active, technology-forward brand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `src/components/AmbientEffect.astro` created with top 2 candidate effects (Grid Pulse and Ambient Glow Shift)
- [ ] Rendered in Hero section only, behind all content
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` disables all motion entirely
- [ ] Mobile (<768px): reduced or disabled without layout shift
- [ ] Works with both light/dark themes and all 6 palettes (uses `--color-primary`, not hardcoded)
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score does not drop more than 2 points on mobile
- [ ] Stakeholder review before proceeding to production polish

#### Technical Context

- Brand alignment concern: brutalism rejects ornament; direct port of bubble/particle effects would NOT align. Must be geometrically structured, monochrome, very restrained — closer to "data field" than "bubbles"
- Top candidates: (1) Grid Pulse — brightness pulses across existing checkerboard grid, (2) Ambient Glow Shift — slow-cycling radial gradients in hero background
- Technical constraints: max 15 animated elements, CSS animations or GPU-composited `transform`/`opacity` only, no JS animation loops, no external dependencies, `pointer-events: none`, `aria-hidden="true"`
- Evaluation criteria: brand test (technology advisory, not consumer), subtlety test (subconscious after a few seconds), performance test, theme test, reduced-motion test, mobile test
- Decision framework: Go (passes all 6 criteria) / No-go (archive, document findings) / Kill (requires external dependencies or exceeds 8h)
- This is exploratory — no commitment to ship
