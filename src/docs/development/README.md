# Development Documentation

This directory contains strategic documentation for ongoing and proposed development initiatives.

## Contents

### [DEVELOPMENT_OPPORTUNITIES.md](./DEVELOPMENT_OPPORTUNITIES.md)

Strategic roadmap of development initiatives focused on:
- **Performance monitoring** (Lighthouse CI integration)
- **Test automation** (E2E and unit tests)
- **Code quality** (Error handling validation)

### [HUB_TOOLS_UX_UNIFICATION.md](./HUB_TOOLS_UX_UNIFICATION.md)

Cross-tool UX unification roadmap — identifies reusable UI patterns (copy feedback, benchmark tables, export bars, collapsibles, dark theme variables) for unification across all five hub tools.

### [TECH_DEBT_CALC_ROADMAP.md](./TECH_DEBT_CALC_ROADMAP.md)

Improvement roadmap for the Tech Debt Cost Calculator (17 initiatives across 7 priority tiers).

### [DYNAMIC_VISUAL_EFFECTS.md](./DYNAMIC_VISUAL_EFFECTS.md)

Exploration initiative evaluating whether ambient animated effects (grid pulses, floating particles, glow shifts) could enhance the homepage hero section without conflicting with the tech-brutalist brand identity. Includes 5 candidate effects ranked by brand alignment, evaluation criteria, and a time-boxed prototype plan.

### [PLATFORM_HARDENING_V1.md](./PLATFORM_HARDENING_V1.md)

8-phase platform hardening initiative to support the next 6 months of business growth. Covers data validation (Zod schemas), CI/CD (ESLint, pre-commit hooks, 3-job pipeline), CSS architecture (Astro scoped styles migration), test coverage & accessibility (axe-core), SEO, tool analytics standardization, error monitoring (Sentry), security headers, and documentation normalization. ~24-29 working days total effort.

### [BUSINESS_ENABLEMENT_V1.md](./BUSINESS_ENABLEMENT_V1.md)

Post-hardening follow-on initiative (~4 days) covering business-facing capabilities that require vendor selection and legal review: Cookie Consent / GDPR compliance (custom banner with GA4 Consent Mode) and Email Capture (footer signup form with Zod validation). Depends on Platform Hardening V1 being complete.

Each roadmap includes:
- Current state assessment with strengths and known issues
- Prioritized initiatives with effort/impact ratings
- Implementation notes and dependency maps
