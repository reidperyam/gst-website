# Developer Tooling

Project-specific reference for the quality tooling installed during Phase 2 of [PLATFORM_HARDENING_V1.md](./PLATFORM_HARDENING_V1.md). Covers what runs when, how to run things manually, where the configuration lives, and how to resolve the most common failure modes.

> This is a reference, not a tutorial. If you need to learn what Prettier or ESLint _are_, read their upstream docs. This document describes how **this specific project** uses them.

**Authoritative local validation sequence** (what CI runs, in the same order):

```bash
npx astro check      # type errors
npm run lint         # ESLint (JS/TS/Astro)
npm run lint:css     # stylelint (CSS)
npm run test:run     # Vitest unit + integration
```

If all four pass locally, CI will almost certainly pass too.

## What runs automatically

### On every `git commit`

The [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) pre-commit hook ([.husky/pre-commit](../../../.husky/pre-commit)) runs [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged), which applies the configured commands **only to the files you staged** (not your whole codebase). This keeps the hook fast — typically under 2 seconds.

The flow:

```
git commit -m "..."
  │
  ├─▶ .husky/pre-commit runs: npx lint-staged
  │
  ├─▶ lint-staged reads staged files and matches them against
  │    the globs in package.json's "lint-staged" config
  │
  ├─▶ For *.{ts,tsx,mjs,cjs,js}:
  │     1. eslint --fix   (auto-fix lint violations)
  │     2. prettier --write (reformat)
  │
  ├─▶ For *.astro:
  │     1. eslint --fix    (JS/TS in frontmatter + script tags)
  │     2. stylelint --fix (scoped <style> blocks)
  │     3. prettier --write
  │
  ├─▶ For *.css:
  │     1. stylelint --fix
  │     2. prettier --write
  │
  ├─▶ For *.{json,md,yaml,yml}:
  │     1. prettier --write
  │
  ├─▶ If any command fails (e.g., ESLint finds a non-fixable error),
  │    the commit is ABORTED and lint-staged restores the original
  │    state from a stash
  │
  ├─▶ If all commands succeed, lint-staged re-stages the cleaned
  │    files so the commit captures the fixed version
  │
  └─▶ Git proceeds with the commit
```

**Important**: the hook runs **before** the commit is recorded. A file you staged with double-quotes and 4-space indent may end up in the commit with single-quotes and 2-space indent — that's Prettier doing its job between the stash and the record. If you see your commit look different than your working tree expected, that's why.

### On every push to `master`, `dev`, `feat/**`, `fix/**` and PRs to `master`

The GitHub Actions workflow [.github/workflows/test.yml](../../../.github/workflows/test.yml) runs a 3-job parallel-then-gate pipeline:

```

```

All three jobs are **required status checks** on two branch rulesets:

- **`master`** (ruleset 12237842) — PRs cannot merge until all checks pass
- **`feat/**` and `fix/**`** (ruleset 15011377) — pushes to feature/fix branches are blocked until checks pass, shifting test failures left instead of deferring to PR time

#### Paths-filter syntax notes (load-bearing)

The gate job uses `dorny/paths-filter@v4` with a specific pattern that is easy to get wrong. Three gotchas surfaced during iteration:

1. **Extended-glob negation does not work**. `'!(**.md|src/docs/**|.claude/**)'` as a single filter entry is accepted by YAML but evaluated by picomatch as always-match, so the gate never fires. Use one negation per list item.
2. **Negation-only patterns need a catch-all**. With `predicate-quantifier: 'every'`, a list of only `!` patterns produces no file that satisfies "every pattern matches" — the catch-all `**` gives picomatch a positive match to start from, which the negations then whittle down.
3. **`base` must point at the pushed branch, not the default branch**. For push events, paths-filter defaults `base` to the repository default branch (`master`). A push to `dev` therefore compares `dev vs master` — the full set of unmerged commits — not just the files in that push. Every push to `dev` then looks like a full code change regardless of what it touched. Setting `base: ${{ github.ref_name }}` triggers the action's "same branch" codepath, which compares against the previous commit on the pushed branch instead.

The correct pattern (mirrors the [dorny/paths-filter README](https://github.com/dorny/paths-filter#example-of-filtering-on-file-extension) canonical example):

```yaml
base: ${{ github.ref_name }} # compare against previous commit on pushed branch
predicate-quantifier: 'every'
list-files: json # emit matched files for diagnostics
filters: |
  code:
    - '**' # positive catch-all
    - '!**/*.md' # negations
    - '!src/docs/**'
    - '!.claude/**'
```

The job also sets `permissions: { contents: read, pull-requests: read }` so paths-filter can use the GitHub API on PR events instead of falling back to git-based detection.

If the gate misbehaves, check the **"Log gate decision"** step output — it prints `code=true/false`, `duplicate=true/false`, `should_run=true/false`, and the JSON-formatted list of matched files, so you can see exactly what the gate saw without having to re-derive the evaluation. If the matched-file count looks suspiciously large (e.g. dozens of files for a single-file push), the `base` configuration is wrong — paths-filter is diffing against the default branch instead of the previous commit.

#### Duplicate-run dedup (fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions)

The gate job also runs [`fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions@v5`](https://github.com/fkirc/skip-duplicate-actions) before paths-filter, which dedupes on **tree hash** (content) rather than commit SHA. The canonical case it catches: push to `dev` passes all three checks → PR `dev→master` fires the same workflow on a synthetic merge-ref SHA whose tree is identical (since master hasn't moved), so the second run is redundant work on content that's already been validated. The action returns `should_skip=true` and the gate's `duplicate` output is `true`; each downstream job's real steps skip and the "Skipped (docs-only or duplicate run)" step runs instead, reporting success to satisfy branch protection.

Key configuration choices:

- `concurrent_skipping: 'same_content_newer'` — when push and PR events fire simultaneously on the same commit (e.g. commit to a branch that already has an open PR), the action sees two concurrent runs with identical tree hashes and skips whichever started second. Combined with the event-scoped concurrency group below, this means exactly one run does the work while the other short-circuits; neither cancels the other, so required status checks don't end up in a cancelled state.
- Workflow-level `concurrency.group` is scoped by `github.event_name` so push and pull_request runs on the same ref don't share a group — they no longer cross-cancel. Previously a push to `dev` with an open PR was cancelled the moment the PR run started, leaving branch protection with a cancelled required check even though the PR run succeeded.
- `skip_after_successful_duplicate: 'true'` (default) — only skip when the duplicate has a **successful** conclusion. A duplicate of a failed run still triggers a fresh test run.
- `do_not_skip: '["workflow_dispatch", "schedule", "merge_group"]'` — manual re-runs via the UI use `workflow_dispatch` and intentionally want to re-test; scheduled runs are cron-driven and shouldn't skip; merge-queue runs must run fresh because the queue may have updated `master` between the PR and the merge-queue entry. Notably `push` and `pull_request` are NOT in this list — they dedupe as expected.

The `actions: write` permission on the gate job is required by skip-duplicate-actions to query prior workflow runs via the REST API.

## Prettier style (this project)

Configured in [.prettierrc.json](../../../.prettierrc.json):

| Setting          | Value      | Effect                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `singleQuote`    | `true`     | `'hello'` not `"hello"`                                                      |
| `trailingComma`  | `"es5"`    | Trailing commas where legal in ES5 (arrays, objects)                         |
| `printWidth`     | `100`      | Wraps long lines at 100 characters                                           |
| `tabWidth`       | `2`        | 2-space indentation                                                          |

| `arrowParens`    | `"always"` | `(x) => x`, not `x => x`                                                     |
| `bracketSpacing` | `true`     | `{ a: 1 }`, not `{a: 1}`                                                     |
| `endOfLine`      | `"lf"`     | Unix line endings (matters on Windows — git's autocrlf should not undo this) |

### What Prettier will NOT format

See [.prettierignore](../../../.prettierignore) for the full list. Notable entries:

- **Hand-curated data files**: `src/data/ma-portfolio/projects.json`, `src/data/canada-provinces.json`
- **Regulatory map content collection**: `src/data/regulatory-map/` (120 JSON files curated manually)
- **Lock files**: `package-lock.json`
- **Generated output**: `dist/`, `.astro/`, `.vercel/`, `coverage/`, `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`

### Known gap — the full-codebase Prettier sweep is deferred

Phase 2 Commit 4 added `.prettierrc.json` but deliberately did NOT run `prettier --write .` on the codebase. Instead, the pre-commit hook formats files incrementally as they're touched. `npm run format:check` currently fails on a large number of legacy files and is therefore NOT wired into CI.

**A full `prettier --write .` sweep is tracked as a Phase 9 backlog item** in [PLATFORM_HARDENING_V1.md](./PLATFORM_HARDENING_V1.md). Once the legacy files are swept, `format:check` will be added to the `lint-and-typecheck` CI job.

Until then: if you want a specific file or directory formatted, run `npx prettier --write <path>` manually.

---

## ESLint configuration notes

The [eslint.config.mjs](../../../eslint.config.mjs) uses the modern **flat config** format (not the legacy `.eslintrc`). Key points:

- **Strictness level**: "recommended" only — starts conservative to avoid drowning the initial rollout in violations. Stricter type-aware rules (`no-unsafe-assignment`, `strict-boolean-expressions`, etc.) can be layered on later.
- **`_`-prefixed names are allowed unused**: `const [_, value] = pair` and `function handler(_event, data)` are both fine. Matches standard Node/TS idiom.
- **Test files get `no-explicit-any: 'off'`**: test fixtures legitimately use `any` for mocks and untyped request bodies.
- **Browser globals are declared per-directory**: `window`, `document`, `navigator`, DOM types — all available in `src/**` and `tests/e2e/**` without import.
- **Node globals are declared for scripts**: `process`, `console`, `fetch`, `Buffer` — available in `scripts/**`, `vitest.config.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`, `eslint.config.mjs`.

### Ignored files

The following files are explicitly excluded from linting:

- Build output: `dist/`, `.astro/`, `.vercel/`, `coverage/`, `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`, `.cache/`, `node_modules/`, `public/`
- Minified vendor assets: `**/*.min.js`, `**/*.min.css`
- Stale one-shot migration scripts at repo root: `abbreviate-arr.js`, `sort-projects.js` (tracked in Phase 9 backlog for deletion)
- `src/pages/hub/tools/techpar/index.astro` — `astro-eslint-parser` emits a spurious parsing error at the `<style>` block boundary on this one file. Other large `.astro` files (including the 3778-line `brand.astro`) parse cleanly. Tracked in Phase 9 backlog for investigation.

---

## stylelint configuration notes

[.stylelintrc.json](../../../.stylelintrc.json) uses a **base config** (for plain `.css` files) plus a dedicated **`.astro` override** that enables stylelint to parse `<style>` blocks inside Astro components.

### How .astro scoped-style linting works

The `.astro` override uses two packages:

- **[postcss-html](https://github.com/ota-meshi/postcss-html)** — a PostCSS custom syntax that knows how to skip frontmatter and HTML, pluck out `<style>` contents, and hand them to stylelint for parsing
- **[stylelint-config-html/astro](https://github.com/ota-meshi/stylelint-config-html)** — a shared stylelint config that registers the Astro-specific file type and wires up defaults

The override block in `.stylelintrc.json`:

```json
"overrides": [
  {
    "files": ["**/*.astro"],
    "extends": ["stylelint-config-standard", "stylelint-config-html/astro"],
    "customSyntax": "postcss-html",
    "rules": { /* same rule set as base config */ }
  }
]
```

The base rules are duplicated inside the `.astro` override because stylelint's `extends` + `overrides` interaction does not inherit rules from the parent config. Keep the two rule sets in sync when editing.

### Running stylelint

```bash
npm run lint:css           # lint src/**/*.{css,astro}
npx stylelint "src/**/*.{css,astro}" --fix   # auto-fix what can be fixed
```

The pre-commit hook runs `stylelint --fix` on staged `.css` and `.astro` files. `.astro` files ALSO pass through `eslint --fix` and `prettier --write` in the same hook.

### `@layer` support

The base and override configs both register `layer` as an allowed at-rule (`at-rule-no-unknown: [true, { "ignoreAtRules": ["import", "layer"] }]`) so CSS cascade layer declarations parse cleanly. This supports the `@layer reset, tokens, utilities, components, theme, overrides;` scheme introduced in Phase 3 commit 0b.

### Complexity rules in the `.astro` override

Phase 3 commit 0c enabled a tighter complexity rule set in the `.astro` override only. These rules are too noisy for legacy `global.css` but are cheap wins in naturally bounded scoped blocks:

- `max-nesting-depth: [3, { ignoreAtRules: [media, supports, container] }]` — prevents deeply nested scoped rules; `@media`, `@supports`, and `@container` don't count toward the depth since they're conditional wrappers, not selector nesting
- `selector-max-compound-selectors: 4` — caps the number of compound selectors in any single selector (e.g., `.a .b .c .d .e` would fail)
- `declaration-block-no-shorthand-property-overrides` — flags patterns like `background-color: red; background: blue;` where the longhand is silently overwritten
- `shorthand-property-no-redundant-values` — flags `padding: 0 0 4px 0` (redundant trailing `0`) and similar; auto-fixable
- `declaration-block-no-redundant-longhand-properties` — flags patterns where multiple longhand declarations could be consolidated into a shorthand

Phase 9 (item #7) enabled two specificity rules at **warning** severity in both the base and `.astro` override:

- `selector-max-specificity: "0,4,1"` — caps specificity to 4 classes + 1 element. The `0,4,1` threshold accommodates `:global(html.dark-theme) .foo .bar .baz` patterns common in hub tool dark-theme overrides
- `no-descending-specificity: true` — flags selectors whose specificity is lower than a preceding selector for the same property, which often indicates unintended cascade order

**Baseline ratchet** (2026-04-13): 4 `selector-max-specificity` + 54 `no-descending-specificity` = 58 total warnings. New code must not increase this count. Existing violations should be reduced opportunistically during future refactors.

### Specimen styles in brand.astro

Brand-page specimen overrides (search, filter, modal, stats, CTA box) were moved from `global.css` into [brand.astro](../../pages/brand.astro) `<style is:global>` during Phase 9. The `stylelint-disable no-duplicate-selectors` guards were removed since the styles are now colocated with their only consumer.

## Accessibility testing

The project uses [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) via `@axe-core/playwright` for automated WCAG 2.1 AA scanning.

### Running locally

```bash
npm run test:a11y        # Scans 6 critical pages (Chromium, ~6 seconds)
```

This runs `tests/e2e/accessibility.test.ts` which scans: Homepage, Services, About, M&A Portfolio, Hub, and TechPar.

### How the ratchet works

- **Critical violations**: must always be zero — blocks merge
- **Serious violations**: new violation IDs must be zero; pre-existing violations (color-contrast, nested-interactive) are tracked in a `KNOWN_SERIOUS` map with per-page max node counts that can only decrease
- **Moderate/minor**: logged for visibility, not enforced

### Shared helper

`tests/e2e/helpers/a11y.ts` exports `checkA11y(page)` which returns violations categorized by severity. Import it in any E2E test:

```typescript
import { checkA11y, formatViolations } from './helpers/a11y';

const results = await checkA11y(page);
expect(results.critical).toHaveLength(0);
```

### Coverage reporting

`npm run test:coverage` reports line coverage via `@vitest/coverage-v8`. Source files under `src/utils/`, `src/data/*.ts`, and `src/scripts/` are instrumented. Current threshold: 35% lines (ratchet — can only increase).

---

## Environment variables

All environment variables are declared in `astro.config.mjs` → `env.schema` using Astro's `envField` helper. This is the **single source of truth** for what vars the app needs, their types, defaults, and access levels.

### How to access env vars

| Context | Import from | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server-side code (`src/lib/`, `.astro` frontmatter) | `astro:env/server` | `import { INOREADER_APP_ID } from 'astro:env/server'` |
| Client-side code (`<script>`, client components) | `astro:env/client` | `import { PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID } from 'astro:env/client'` |
| Vite built-ins (`PROD`, `DEV`, `MODE`) | `import.meta.env` | `import.meta.env.PROD` (these are NOT custom vars) |
| Build-time config (`astro.config.mjs`) | `process.env` | Only for vars read before Astro initializes (Sentry auth token) |

### Rules

- **Never use `process.env` in `src/`** — ESLint `no-restricted-properties` enforces this. Use `astro:env/server` or `astro:env/client` instead.
- **Server secrets** (`access: "secret"`) are never inlined into the build output. They're resolved at runtime by the Vercel adapter, which is why server islands (`server:defer`) work safely.
- **Public vars** (`access: "public"`) are inlined at build time. Use the `PUBLIC_` prefix convention.
- **`.env` file** is for local development only (loaded by Astro dev server). Production vars are set in Vercel dashboard.
- **`.env.example`** documents all vars with placeholder values. Keep it in sync when adding new vars.

### Testing

Vitest can't resolve `astro:env/*` virtual modules. Test stubs live at:
- `tests/__mocks__/astro-env-server.ts` — exports `undefined` for all server vars
- `tests/__mocks__/astro-env-client.ts` — exports defaults for public vars

Tests that need specific env values should use `vi.mock('astro:env/server', () => ({ ... }))` with `vi.hoisted()` for the factory object.

## Error monitoring (Sentry)

The site uses [@sentry/astro](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/) for error monitoring, configured as an Astro integration in `astro.config.mjs`.

| Config file               | Purpose                                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `sentry.client.config.ts` | Client-side init — error capture + error-only replay |
| `sentry.server.config.ts` | Server-side init — SSR error capture (Radar page)    |
| `astro.config.mjs`        | Integration registration + source map upload config  |

**Key settings**: No PII (`sendDefaultPii: false`), no performance tracing (`tracesSampleRate: 0`), error-only replay (`replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0`), disabled in development (`enabled: import.meta.env.PROD`). DSN is imported from `astro:env/client` (declared in env schema).

**Environment variables**:

- `PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` — declared in env schema, set in Vercel (Production + Preview)
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT` — optional, for source map upload

**Error tags used in `captureException`**: `area:inoreader-api`, `area:redis-connection`, `area:file-cache`, `area:palette-manager`, `area:techpar-calculation`

**Viewing errors**: Log in to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), select the `gst-website` project. Filter by tag (`area:inoreader-api`) to see specific subsystem failures.

### Alert rules

Configure these in the Sentry dashboard under **Alerts → Create Alert Rule** for the `gst-website` project:

| Rule                                    | Condition                                            | Action         |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| New issue                               | A new issue is created                               | Email (owner)  |
| High-volume errors                      | >10 events/hour on any page                          | Email (owner)  |
| Inoreader API failures                  | New issue with tag `area:inoreader-api`              | Email (owner)  |
| Redis connection failures               | New issue with tag `area:redis-connection`            | Email (owner)  |

These rules are configured externally in Sentry's UI, not in code. The tag filters rely on the `area` tags set in `captureException` calls throughout the codebase.

### Source map upload

Source maps enable readable stack traces in Sentry. The `sentry()` integration is conditionally included in `astro.config.mjs` — only when `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is present. This means local builds and CI have zero Sentry overhead.

When the token is set (Vercel production), `@sentry/astro` automatically:
- Enables `sourcemap: 'hidden'` for the server build
- Detects Vercel output directories (`{.vercel,dist}/**/*`)
- Uploads maps and deletes them after upload

**`vite.build.sourcemap: 'hidden'`** is set explicitly in user config because Astro's client build doesn't pick up integration config changes (only server build does). This ensures both client and server maps are generated.

**Telemetry**: Disabled (`telemetry: false`).

**Required env vars** (Production only — do NOT add to `.env` locally):

- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` — create an Organization Token at sentry.io → Settings → Developer Settings → Organization Tokens. See [SENTRY_MANUAL_SETUP.md](./SENTRY_MANUAL_SETUP.md)
- `SENTRY_ORG` — your Sentry organization slug
- `SENTRY_PROJECT` — the project slug (e.g., `gst-website`)

Add all three to **Vercel → Project Settings → Environment Variables** (Production only).

### Privacy and consent evaluation

Evaluated during Phase 9 (2026-04-13):

- **Pure error capture** (`captureException`, `captureMessage`): Classified as **legitimate interest** under GDPR — diagnostic data for maintaining service reliability. No consent required.
- **Error-only replay** (`replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0`): Records DOM state only when an error occurs. Arguably still legitimate interest since it is diagnostic, not behavioral tracking. No session replay for general browsing.
- **No PII**: `sendDefaultPii: false` prevents automatic collection of user identifiers, IP addresses, or cookies.
- **Decision**: Keep current configuration as legitimate interest. Re-evaluate when [BUSINESS_ENABLEMENT_V1.md](./BUSINESS_ENABLEMENT_V1.md) ships a cookie consent banner — at that point, consider gating replay behind analytics consent while keeping error capture ungated.

---

## Browser support

The project declares its supported browsers in the `"browserslist"` field of [package.json](../../../package.json):

```json
"browserslist": [
  "defaults",
  "Safari >= 14",
  "not IE 11"
]
```

- **`"defaults"`** resolves via [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) to `> 0.5%, last 2 versions, Firefox ESR, not dead` — a standard modern-browser target set covering ~95%+ of global traffic.
- **`"Safari >= 14"`** is an explicit floor that keeps older Safari in the target set. This is load-bearing: without it, LightningCSS would decide the `-webkit-` prefixed form of properties like `backdrop-filter` is unnecessary and strip it, breaking legacy Safari.
- **`"not IE 11"`** is a defensive exclusion; IE is already dead in `defaults` but the explicit line documents the decision.

### How browser targets are used

Several parts of the build read from the `browserslist` field automatically:

1. **LightningCSS** (via [astro.config.mjs](../../../astro.config.mjs)) — reads browserslist at config load time via `browserslistToTargets(browserslist())`, then uses the resolved targets to:
   - Down-level modern CSS features (nesting, `oklch`, `color-mix`, `light-dark`)
   - Add vendor prefixes where needed (`-webkit-backdrop-filter`, `-moz-appearance`, etc.)
   - Strip unnecessary vendor prefixes when all targets support the unprefixed form
2. **Any future tools** that respect the [browserslist standard](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#shareable-configs) — autoprefixer, stylelint browser-compat rules, ESLint compat plugins, Vite's own esbuild fallback — will all read from the same source of truth without extra config.

### Vendor prefix policy (load-bearing)

**Do not manually write vendor-prefixed CSS properties** (`-webkit-backdrop-filter`, `-moz-user-select`, etc.) in source. LightningCSS is the authoritative prefix-adder, driven by the browserslist config.

If source contains BOTH a prefixed and unprefixed form of the same property with identical values, LightningCSS treats them as duplicates and ships only one (normally the one matching its internal target logic), which can silently break support in browsers that need the other form. The only safe pattern is to write the unprefixed form and let LightningCSS handle prefixes:

```css
/* Correct — LightningCSS adds -webkit- prefix for Safari 14 automatically */
.frosted {
  backdrop-filter: blur(3px);
}

/* WRONG — caused the Phase 3 regression where Firefox users lost frosted glass */
.frosted {
  backdrop-filter: blur(3px);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(3px); /* don't do this */
}
```

This policy is enforced socially (code review + STYLES_GUIDE.md note) rather than mechanically. A future stylelint rule could catch it — tracked as a Phase 9 opportunity.

### Changing browser support

If you need to add or remove supported browsers:

1. Edit the `"browserslist"` field in `package.json`.
2. Run `npx browserslist` to see the resolved target list and confirm it's what you expect.
3. Run `npm run build` and eyeball the CSS output diff for any unexpected prefix additions or removals.
4. If shipping a visible behavior change, coordinate with the design review.

---

## npm audit policy

Phase 2 CI runs:

```bash
npm audit --audit-level=moderate --omit=dev
```

**Why `--omit=dev`**: dev-only advisories (e.g., `@astrojs/check` → `yaml-language-server` → `yaml`) affect local development tooling but never reach users. Production dependencies must stay at zero advisories; dev-only moderate advisories are tolerated and revisited case-by-case.

**Current production state**: zero vulnerabilities (verified post-Phase-2).

**Package overrides** — see [package.json](../../../package.json) `overrides` block:

- `path-to-regexp: 6.3.0` — forces the patched version across the dependency tree to close `GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j` without a destructive `@astrojs/vercel` downgrade. Re-evaluate when `@vercel/routing-utils` ships a clean upgrade path.

---

## Common workflows

### "I want to format the whole codebase right now"

```bash
npm run format
```

Be aware this will produce a large diff against the current state. The expected place to do this is as a single standalone commit during the Phase 9 sweep, not piecemeal during feature work.

### "My commit was rejected by the pre-commit hook"

1. **Read the error** — the hook shows which command failed and which file triggered it
2. **Common causes**:
   - **ESLint found a non-auto-fixable violation**: open the file, fix the violation, re-stage, re-commit
   - **Prettier failed to parse your file**: syntax error in the code, fix it
   - **stylelint found a CSS error**: same remediation as ESLint
3. **`lint-staged` has already rolled back the stash**, so your working tree is back to its pre-commit state. No changes were lost.

### "CI fails but it passes locally"

Run the exact CI sequence locally:

```bash
npm ci                   # clean install from lockfile (matches CI)
npx astro check
npm run lint
npm run lint:css
npm audit --audit-level=moderate --omit=dev
npm run test:run
```

If all six pass, the failure is likely E2E-only or environment-specific. Check:

- Playwright browser version mismatch (CI uses `npx playwright install --with-deps`)
- Timezone or locale dependency (CI runs in UTC)
- Network requests the test accidentally makes (all production traffic should be mocked)

### "My push/PR ran tests when I expected it to skip"

Open the run on the Actions tab and expand the **Detect Code Changes** job's "Log gate decision" step. It prints `code`, `duplicate`, `should_run`, and the matched file list — that's exactly what the gate saw.

- **`should_run=true`, large `matched-files` list (dozens of files for a one-file push)**: paths-filter is diffing against the wrong base. Confirm `base: ${{ github.ref_name }}` is present on the paths-filter step; without it, the action defaults to the repo's default branch (`master`) and the filter sees every unmerged commit on the current branch
- **`should_run=false` but jobs still ran full flow**: a step is missing the `if: needs.changes.outputs.should_run == 'true'` guard somewhere
- **`code=true`, sensible file list on a pure docs push**: the filter matched a file you didn't expect — inspect the list. Adjust the negations or add a new one (docs directory? config file? auto-generated artifact? lock file?)
- **`duplicate=false` when a prior successful run had the same content**: the prior run may have failed or been cancelled (only `success` conclusions dedupe), or the tree hash differs (one file changed that you didn't realize — check `git diff <prior-sha>..HEAD --stat`). Manual re-runs via the UI intentionally bypass dedup via `do_not_skip: ["workflow_dispatch", ...]`
- **`duplicate=true` but you wanted a re-run**: trigger via "Re-run all jobs" in the Actions UI (uses `workflow_dispatch`, bypasses dedup) rather than pushing a no-op commit
- **PR blocked with a cancelled push-event check alongside a successful pull_request-event check**: the workflow's concurrency group must be scoped by `github.event_name` — without it, the two events collide in the same group and `cancel-in-progress: true` cancels the first-started run. Immediate fix: `gh run rerun <cancelled-run-id>` on the cancelled run (safe because the sibling has already completed). Durable fix: confirm the workflow's `concurrency.group` includes `github.event_name`

Never remove the positive `**` catch-all when adding more negations — with `predicate-quantifier: 'every'`, a negation-only list always produces `code=false` regardless of the actual changeset.

### "I need to temporarily skip the hook"

**Don't.** The hook exists for a reason. If you genuinely have an emergency:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency: ..."
```

Then immediately follow up with a normal commit that fixes whatever the hook would have caught. CI will still enforce everything the hook enforces, plus tests, so `--no-verify` only defers the problem by ~1 minute.

### "I need to update a dependency and the override blocks it"

The `overrides` block in `package.json` pins `path-to-regexp: 6.3.0`. If you upgrade `@astrojs/vercel` to a version whose transitive `path-to-regexp` is already 6.3.0+ or later, you can delete the override. Verify by running `npm audit --omit=dev` after the upgrade — if it stays at zero vulnerabilities, the override is safe to remove.

### "I want to run tests only for one file"

```bash
npx vitest run tests/unit/filterLogic.test.ts
```

Or pass a name pattern:

```bash
npx vitest run -t "categorizeGrowthStage"
```

### "I want to see the coverage report locally"

```bash
npm run test:coverage
# Then open coverage/index.html in a browser
```

## Post-merge manual steps for Phase 2

Two manual steps are required to complete Phase 2. Both are documented in [PLATFORM_HARDENING_V1.md § Phase 2 Post-Merge Manual Steps](./PLATFORM_HARDENING_V1.md#post-merge-manual-steps). Summary:

1. **Update branch protection ruleset** to add `Lint & Type Check` to the required-checks list on ruleset 12237842. Must happen AFTER the Phase 2 PR merges to master. Full `gh` CLI recipe in the hardening doc.
2. **Verify `astro dev` no longer emits the `[content] Content config not loaded` warning** — resolved by adding an empty `src/content.config.ts`, but only verifiable on a fresh dev server startup.
