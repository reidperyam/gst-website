## Context

GST has two production-grade pure-TypeScript engines that today are reachable only through the website's UI: the **diligence-agenda generator** ([`generateScript`](../../utils/diligence-engine.ts)) and the **portfolio search** ([`filterProjects`](../../utils/filterLogic.ts)). Both are pure functions, both have stable Zod schemas, both are unit-tested, and both have zero DOM/Astro coupling.

Every interactive use of these engines today is gated by a browser context-switch: open a tab, fill a wizard, copy the output back into the document being drafted. For someone drafting a client proposal, agenda, or pitch in Claude Desktop, that round-trip dominates the work. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) lets us expose these engines as native tools to any Claude surface, eliminating the round-trip and turning the engines into composable building blocks of agentic workflows.

BL-031 is the smallest, lowest-risk slice of that vision: a **local stdio MCP server** that any GST team member can install in 60 seconds, used as a private internal tool. It is the de-risking step before BL-032 (remote, internal HTTP) and BL-033 (external pilot with OAuth + audit logging). The acceptance criteria are scoped to "wrap two pure functions, expose them, run from Claude Desktop / Claude Code, no auth, no HTTP."

This document also addresses two design questions that shape the entire MCP roadmap: **repo placement** (monorepo vs. separate) and **lifecycle coupling** (evolves with the website vs. independently).

## MCP Architecture & Design — Introduction

### What MCP is

The Model Context Protocol is an open JSON-RPC-based standard (originally published by Anthropic, now adopted by Claude, Cursor, OpenAI's MCP-compatible mode, and others) for connecting AI assistants to external context and tools. An MCP **server** publishes capabilities; an MCP **client** (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) discovers and invokes them.

A server can expose three kinds of capabilities — for BL-031 we use only the first:

| Primitive     | Purpose                                                   | BL-031 use?     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Tools**     | Functions the model can call with structured input/output | ✅ both engines |
| **Resources** | Read-only data (file-like) the model can fetch            | ❌ not needed   |
| **Prompts**   | Pre-written templates a user can invoke                   | ❌ not needed   |

### Transports

| Transport           | Use case                                                                     | Auth                       | Phase          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- |
| **stdio**           | Client spawns the server as a child process; communication over stdin/stdout | None (process-level trust) | **BL-031**     |
| **Streamable HTTP** | Client opens a long-lived HTTP connection to a remote endpoint               | Bearer token / OAuth       | BL-032, BL-033 |

The same tool registry serves both transports — register-once, connect-twice — which is precisely why BL-031 (stdio) is a sound foundation for BL-032 (HTTP) and BL-033 (OAuth + audit).

### Value GST gets from this architecture

1. **Tools follow the user.** Every Claude surface — Desktop, Code, mobile app, IDE extensions — can call the same tools. The "I need to be at my desk with the website open" constraint disappears.
2. **Composability across servers.** GST tools sit alongside filesystem, GitHub, Slack, and Linear MCP servers in the same Claude session. An agent drafting a client memo can pull a comparable engagement (`search_portfolio`), generate an agenda (`generate_diligence_agenda`), and write the result into a Google Doc — one model, three tool sources.
3. **Distribution leverage at BL-033.** Public MCP directories (Anthropic registry, MCPMarket, Cursor catalog) become a no-cost discovery channel for technically-sophisticated buyers — the kind of inbound funnel a boutique advisory firm normally cannot afford to build.
4. **Transport-agnostic investment.** Tool implementations are written once. Transport, auth, and rate-limiting are layered on top in BL-032/033. The work in BL-031 is not throwaway scaffolding.
5. **Schema as contract.** Every tool ships a Zod input schema. That schema is the contract — clients (human or model) can introspect it, validate it client-side, and detect drift before invocation. This is more disciplined than the website's wizard, which encodes the same shape in JSX.

### Critical SDK note

The original [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) BL-031 text references `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. **This package name is stale.** As of late 2025 / early 2026 the TypeScript SDK has split into a v2 package family:

- `@modelcontextprotocol/server` — server-side primitives (`McpServer`, `StdioServerTransport`, `registerTool`)
- `@modelcontextprotocol/client` — client-side
- `@modelcontextprotocol/hono` — HTTP transport adapter (relevant only for BL-032)
- The legacy single-package `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` is maintained on a `v1.x` branch but is not the new-work default

The plan below targets **v2 (`@modelcontextprotocol/server`)**. The v2 SDK accepts Zod schemas natively (no `zod-to-json-schema` shim needed), uses `server.registerTool(name, config, handler)`, and surfaces tool errors via `{ isError: true, content: [...] }` in the `CallToolResult` — which is exactly the "structured MCP error, not a thrown exception" the backlog calls for.

## Discovery, connection, build, and deployment

This section covers how MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, and others) actually find, run, and use the BL-031 server. The mechanics differ sharply from [BL-032](BACKLOG.md#bl-032-mcp-server--internal-remote-phase-2) (remote HTTP) and [BL-033](BACKLOG.md#bl-033-mcp-server--external-pilot-phase-3) (external pilot with OAuth + public MCP-directory listings) — those phases' discovery story is documented in their own initiative entries.

### Discovery — manual config per client

There is no global registry at this phase. Each MCP-aware client reads its own config file; a team member pastes the snippet from `mcp-server/README.md` once and the client picks the server up at next launch.

| Client                      | Config file                                                       | Snippet shape                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Desktop (macOS)      | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` | `mcpServers.gst-tools = { command: "node", args: ["/abs/path/to/mcp-server/dist/index.js"] }`                 |
| Claude Desktop (Windows)    | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`                     | same shape; absolute Windows path                                                                             |
| Claude Code (project-level) | `.mcp.json` at repo root                                          | `mcpServers.gst-tools = { command: "node", args: ["./mcp-server/dist/index.js"] }` — relative path OK         |
| Claude Code (user-level)    | `~/.claude/settings.json` `mcpServers` entry                      | same shape; absolute path                                                                                     |
| Cursor                      | `~/.cursor/mcp.json`                                              | same shape                                                                                                    |
| ChatGPT (Desktop / web)     | "Connectors" UI                                                   | not stdio-capable; needs HTTP transport — see [BL-032](BACKLOG.md#bl-032-mcp-server--internal-remote-phase-2) |

### Connection — child-process spawn over stdio

When a client launches, it reads its config and **spawns the server as a child process**. JSON-RPC messages flow over the child's stdin/stdout, framed by Content-Length headers per the Language Server Protocol convention MCP inherits. There is no port, no network, no listening socket. Trust is process-level — the user has already chosen to put the binary on their own machine.

Implications for our code:

- `console.log` is forbidden — anything written to stdout becomes corrupt protocol data. All logging goes to `console.error` (stderr). The client may surface stderr to the user (Claude Desktop shows it in the MCP server panel; Claude Code shows it in `.claude/logs/`).
- The server runs only as long as the client is open. Each client launch spawns a fresh process; there is no shared state across runs.
- The server's `cwd` is whatever the client launched with — typically the user's home directory, NOT the repo root. Path resolution must use `import.meta.url` + `fileURLToPath`, never `process.cwd()`.

### Use — `tools/list` then `tools/call`

Once the connection is up, the client immediately calls `initialize`, then `tools/list`. The server responds with the three tool definitions (name, description, JSON-Schema input). The client renders these in its tool picker and exposes them to the model.

When the model decides to call a tool, the client sends `tools/call { name, arguments }`; the server validates against the Zod schema, invokes the underlying engine, and returns either `{ content: [...], structuredContent }` (success) or `{ isError: true, content: [...] }` (validation failure or runtime error). The model sees the response inline and continues the conversation.

### Build — `tsc` to `dist/index.js`

`cd mcp-server && npm run build` runs `tsc` against `mcp-server/tsconfig.json`, compiling `src/**/*.ts` to `dist/`. The `bin` field in `mcp-server/package.json` declares `dist/index.js` as the executable entry point. Source maps stay on so stack traces in stderr logs point back at TypeScript line numbers.

### Deployment — there isn't one

There is no deploy step in BL-031. Each team member runs the server on their own machine, started by their MCP client on demand. Updates ship the same way as any other repo change: `git pull && npm install && cd mcp-server && npm run build`. A teammate who pulls a new tool registration sees it in their client at the next client launch.

### Where the server lives

- **Source code**: `mcp-server/` workspace inside the `gst-website` monorepo. Imported engines stay in the `src/utils/` and `src/data/` directories of the same repo via relative imports — that is the entire point of the [Repo placement](#repo-placement--single-repo-recommended) decision below.
- **Compiled binary**: `mcp-server/dist/index.js` on each team member's machine, built locally.
- **Runtime**: a child process of whichever MCP client launched it; lives only while that client is open.
- **Public surface**: none. The server is not network-addressable, not registered anywhere, and not discoverable by anyone outside the team.

This stays true through [BL-031.5](MCP_SERVER_HUB_SURFACE_BL-031_5.md) (adds Resources) and [BL-031.75](MCP_SERVER_PROMPTS_BL-031_75.md) (adds Prompts) — those initiatives extend the surface but do not change the transport, build, or deploy story. [BL-032](BACKLOG.md#bl-032-mcp-server--internal-remote-phase-2) is the first phase where the server becomes a deployed, network-addressable artifact (Cloudflare Workers); [BL-033](BACKLOG.md#bl-033-mcp-server--external-pilot-phase-3) is when it becomes publicly discoverable (MCP directory listings).

## Repo placement — single repo (recommended)

|                        | Same repo (chosen)                                           | Separate repo                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Engine sync            | Direct relative imports — single source of truth, atomic PRs | Requires npm publish, submodule, or copy-paste — drift risk |
| CI                     | One workflow gains one workspace; ~1 min added               | Two pipelines, two release processes                        |
| Onboarding             | `git clone gst-website && cd mcp-server && npm install`      | `git clone gst-website && git clone gst-mcp && link them`   |
| IP isolation           | None — fine while server is internal                         | Helpful if MCP source needs to be shared/audited externally |
| Independent versioning | Not yet needed                                               | Premature for a 1–2 day prototype with one consumer         |

**Decision: monorepo via npm workspaces.** Add `"workspaces": [".", "mcp-server"]` to root `package.json`; create `mcp-server/` with its own `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `README.md`. The Astro build is untouched (Astro's tsconfig already excludes the directory by virtue of the workspace boundary).

**Re-evaluation trigger for splitting at BL-033 (not now):**

- External clients require source-code review and we can't expose the website
- Compliance scope (SOC 2, pen test) becomes easier with a smaller blast radius
- IP licensing posture demands a clean commercial boundary
- A second consumer of the engines emerges (e.g. a Slack bot, a Retool app)

Until any of those triggers fires, the same-repo cost (zero) dominates the future-flexibility cost (negligible — splitting later is mechanical).

## Lifecycle and evolution

| Phase      | Coupling to website                 | Versioning                                     | Why                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BL-031** | **Tight — relative imports**        | Website git SHA                                | Engine drift is the dominant risk; single-source-of-truth eliminates it.                                                                                                |
| **BL-032** | **Tight engines, loose deployment** | Website git SHA + `wrangler` deploy id         | Engines still imported relatively; deployment moves to Cloudflare Workers (separate from Vercel — explicit blast-radius isolation).                                     |
| **BL-033** | **Loose — schema as contract**      | Independent semver applied to tool I/O schemas | External clients pin a tool-schema version; engines may evolve faster than the public contract. The MCP server becomes a translation/versioning layer over the engines. |

**Operating rule applied in BL-031:** the engines are the truth, the MCP wrapper is a thin adapter, and the schema lives in [`src/schemas/`](../../schemas/) so a single PR updates wizard config + engine + MCP simultaneously. The first time we need to ship a breaking change to the diligence schema with external clients depending on it, that's the trigger to introduce schema-version semantics — not before.

### Tools to expose

#### `generate_diligence_agenda`

- Wraps `generateScript(inputs)` from [src/utils/diligence-engine.ts](../../utils/diligence-engine.ts).
- Input schema: derived **once** in `mcp-server/src/schemas.ts` from the enum lists in [wizard-config.ts](../../data/diligence-machine/wizard-config.ts) and the `UserInputs` interface. Each enum field uses `z.enum([...])` against the canonical values (transactionType, productType, techArchetype, headcount, revenueRange, growthStage, companyAge, businessModel, scaleIntensity, transformationState, dataSensitivity, operatingModel) plus `geographies: z.array(z.enum([...]))`.
- Output: full `GeneratedScript` (topics, attentionAreas, triggerMap, metadata) JSON-stringified into a `text` content block. Optionally also populate `structuredContent` with the same object so MCP clients that support structured output can parse without re-stringification.
- Validation failure: return `{ isError: true, content: [{ type: 'text', text: 'Validation failed: ...' }] }`. Never throw.

#### `search_portfolio`

- Wraps `filterProjects(projects, criteria)` from [src/utils/filterLogic.ts](../../utils/filterLogic.ts).
- Loads `projects.json` once at module-init using `fileURLToPath(new URL('../../../src/data/ma-portfolio/projects.json', import.meta.url))`; validates with `ProjectsArraySchema` from [src/schemas/portfolio.ts](../../schemas/portfolio.ts).
- Input: `{ search?: string, theme?: string ('all' default), engagement?: string ('all' default), limit?: number (default 20, max 61) }`.
- Output: `{ matches: Project[], totalMatched: number, returned: number }` — array slice + count summary, JSON-stringified into a `text` content block.

#### `list_portfolio_facets` (companion tool — included in Phase 1)

- Returns `{ themes: string[], engagementCategories: string[], growthStages: string[], years: number[] }` by composing `getUniqueThemes`, `getUniqueEngagementCategories`, `getUniqueGrowthStages`, `getUniqueYears` from [filterLogic.ts](../../utils/filterLogic.ts).
- Saves an LLM round-trip when discovering valid filter values. No input parameters.

### Server bootstrap (sketch)

```ts
// mcp-server/src/index.ts
import { McpServer, StdioServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/server';
import { registerDiligenceTool } from './tools/diligence.js';
import { registerPortfolioTools } from './tools/portfolio.js';

const server = new McpServer({ name: 'gst-tools', version: '0.1.0' });
registerDiligenceTool(server);
registerPortfolioTools(server);

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
console.error('[gst-mcp] connected on stdio'); // stdout is reserved for protocol — log to stderr
```

### TypeScript & lint configuration

- `mcp-server/tsconfig.json` — standalone strict config: `target: ES2022`, `module: NodeNext`, `moduleResolution: NodeNext`, `strict: true`, `outDir: dist`, `rootDir: src`. Does **NOT** extend `astro/tsconfigs/strict` (which would import Astro types unnecessarily).
- Existing flat ESLint config at repo root automatically covers the new directory. Confirm by running `npm run lint` after scaffolding.
- The Astro `tsconfig.json` `include: ["**/*"]` will pick up `mcp-server/**/*.ts`. Add `mcp-server` to its `exclude` array to keep Astro's type checker out of the new workspace.

### Verification (run before marking complete)

1. `cd mcp-server && npm run build` — produces `dist/index.js`, no type errors.
2. `cd mcp-server && npm test` — Vitest green: happy-path, invalid-input rejection (expect `isError: true` not a thrown stack trace), empty-result, schema-bound enum violation, and `list_portfolio_facets` output shape.
3. From repo root: `npx astro check && npm run lint && npm run lint:css && npm run test:run` — still green; the canonical local-validation sequence from [DEVELOPER_TOOLING.md](DEVELOPER_TOOLING.md) must remain passing.
4. Add the local server to `claude_desktop_config.json` per the README snippet, restart Claude Desktop, confirm the three tools appear in the tool list.
5. Invoke `generate_diligence_agenda` with the README's worked example (a representative `b2b-saas` / `modern-cloud-native` / `majority-stake` payload), confirm a non-empty topic list and a sensible `metadata.totalQuestions`.
6. Invoke `search_portfolio { search: 'CRM', engagement: 'Value Creation' }`, confirm matches return.
7. Invoke `generate_diligence_agenda` with `transactionType: "foo"` (invalid enum), confirm a clean `isError: true` content block — no stack trace.
8. Compare a wizard output from `localhost:4321/hub/tools/diligence-machine` against the MCP output for the same inputs — they MUST be identical (zero behavior divergence is an explicit BL-031 outcome).

### Out of scope (deferred to BL-032 / BL-033)

- HTTP transport, Cloudflare Worker deployment, `wrangler.toml`
- Bearer-token auth, OAuth 2.1, PKCE, dynamic client registration
- Rate limiting, Upstash Redis, sliding-window quotas
- Radar tools (`search_radar`, `get_latest_insights`) — require Inoreader credentials and 6h cache (see [RADAR.md](../hub/RADAR.md))
- Audit logging, R2 immutable storage, hash-chain integrity
- Prompt-injection sanitization (the diligence/portfolio surfaces have no user-supplied free-text egress in BL-031)
- Public listing on MCP directories

---

## Phase 2 (BL-032) — at a glance

Remote internal deployment to Cloudflare Workers with Streamable HTTP transport and bearer-token auth. Adds the radar tools (`search_radar`, `get_latest_insights`) which require Upstash Redis caching to honor Inoreader's 200 req/day budget. Tool registry is shared with Phase 1 — register-once, transport-twice. Full acceptance criteria: [BACKLOG.md § BL-032](BACKLOG.md#bl-032-mcp-server--internal-remote-phase-2).

## Phase 3 (BL-033) — at a glance

External pilot with PE design partners. OAuth 2.1 (PKCE-mandatory), tool-level scopes, append-only audit logs to R2, prompt-injection hardening on radar surface, public listing on MCP directories. This is the phase where the repo-split decision and schema-versioning discipline get re-evaluated. Full acceptance criteria: [BACKLOG.md § BL-033](BACKLOG.md#bl-033-mcp-server--external-pilot-phase-3).
