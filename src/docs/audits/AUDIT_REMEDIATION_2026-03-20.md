## Finding Disposition

| # | Severity | Finding | Status | Notes |
|---|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| 1 | CRITICAL | Canonical URLs point to localhost:4321 | **Resolved** | Fixed prior to audit delivery. `site` property in `astro.config.mjs` set to `https://globalstrategic.tech`. Commit `ae1b83b`. |
| 2 | CRITICAL | Site not indexed by Google | **Resolved** | Root cause was the canonical URL issue (#1). Fix deployed; reindexing requested via Google Search Console. |
| 3 | HIGH | No sitemap.xml detected | **Already in place** | `sitemap.xml` exists at `/sitemap.xml` with 17 URLs covering all public pages. Referenced in `robots.txt`. |
| 4 | HIGH | No robots.txt detected | **Already in place** | `robots.txt` exists at `/robots.txt` with crawler directives and sitemap reference. |
| 5 | MEDIUM | Meta description exceeds 160 chars | **Resolved** | Shortened from 236 to 148 characters. Value proposition front-loaded for SERP display. Updated in both the homepage and the SEO component default. Commit `1a8401e`. |
| 6 | MEDIUM | No skip navigation link | **Resolved** | Added `.skip-nav` link to the base layout. Hidden off-screen by default, visible on keyboard focus. Links to `#main-content` on the `<main>` element. Commit `9e05b55`. |
| 7 | MEDIUM | No ARIA landmark roles | **Resolved** | Added explicit `role="banner"` to `<header>`, `role="navigation"` with `aria-label="Main navigation"` to `<nav>`, `role="main"` to `<main>`, and `role="contentinfo"` to `<footer>`. Commit `659b1b5`. |
| 8 | MEDIUM | Inconsistent Calendly link attributes | **Resolved** | Hero CTA now conditionally applies `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for all external (`http`) hrefs, matching the footer CTA behavior. Commit `6682036`. |
| 9 | MEDIUM | 1 image missing alt text | **Already in place** | The delta icon in `Header.astro` has `alt="Global Strategic Technologies logo"` with `aria-hidden="true"` (brand name corrected March 24, 2026). The delta icon in `ThemeToggle.astro` has `alt=""` with `aria-hidden="true"` (correct pattern for decorative images per WCAG). All About page images have descriptive alt text. |
| 10 | MEDIUM | FAQPage schema markup missing | **Already in place** | `FAQPage` JSON-LD schema is implemented in `SEO.astro` and wired to the Services page FAQ section via the `faqItems` prop. Schema is rendered as a separate `<script type="application/ld+json">` block. |
| 11 | LOW | No lazy loading on images | **Resolved** | Added `loading="lazy"` to all 93 below-fold images site-wide (homepage, services, hub tools, library articles, diligence machine, TechPar, about page). 2 LCP founder photos retain `fetchpriority="high"` per Core Web Vitals best practice. 0 images remain without an explicit loading strategy. Commits `86416fd`, `1d7ed4b`. |
| 12 | LOW | No responsive images (srcset) | **Deferred** | Current image set is minimal (founder photos, signatures, SVG icons). The site's sub-250ms load time and small resource count make this low-impact. Will evaluate if additional raster imagery is added. |
| 13 | LOW | Content depth / thought leadership | **Deferred** | Content strategy item. The Hub section is actively being expanded with tools (TechPar, Diligence Machine, Regulatory Map, etc.) that serve as substantive thought leadership. Blog/article content is on the roadmap. |

## Verification

- **Unit/Integration Tests**: 801 tests across 23 test files — all passing
- **Production Build**: Completes successfully with no errors
- **Test Coverage**: Exceeds 70% threshold
- **Affected E2E tests**: Checked — no test assertions reference changed strings. Existing selectors (e.g., `main, [role="main"]`) are compatible with the ARIA role additions.
