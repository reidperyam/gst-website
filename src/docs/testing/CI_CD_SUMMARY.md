### 🔧 GitHub Actions Workflow Files

1. **.github/workflows/test.yml** (Main Test Workflow) ✅ OPTIMIZED
   - Runs on every push to main/develop and every PR
   - Unit & Integration tests (Node 18.x and 20.x)
   - E2E tests with Playwright (optimized timeouts: 4min)
   - Build verification
   - Coverage reporting
   - Test results summary

   **Status:** 552/552 tests passing, fully operational (180 unit/integration + 372 E2E)

2. **.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml** ❌ REMOVED
   - Was redundant - removed to eliminate false status reporting
   - Vercel's native integration handles preview deployments

3. **.github/workflows/deployment-status.yml** ❌ REMOVED
   - Was redundant - Vercel posts all deployment status natively

## How GitHub Actions + Vercel Interact

### Key Principle
**Tests and deployment are independent and simultaneous**

```
Event: git push main
├─ GitHub Actions triggered immediately
│  └─ Runs tests in parallel
├─ Vercel webhook triggered immediately
│  └─ Builds and deploys in parallel
└─ Both complete independently

Result: Tests complete in ~10 minutes
        Vercel deploys in ~5 minutes
        → Vercel is usually done FIRST
```

### Why This Design?
1. **No deployment delays** - Vercel deploys immediately
2. **Tests are feedback** - Not blockers on main (they still run)
3. **Branch protection** - Tests ARE blockers on PRs (prevents bad merges)
4. **Best of both** - Speed + Safety

### You Can Always Rollback
If tests fail but code deployed:
```bash
# Revert main to previous commit
git revert HEAD

# Push revert
git push origin main

# Vercel redeploys (cleaner than manual rollback)
```

---

## When Tests Run

### Test.yml Triggers

✅ **Runs on:**
- Push to `main` branch
- Push to `develop` branch
- Create pull request to `main`
- Push to any open PR to `main`

❌ **Does not run on:**
- Push to other branches
- Pushes to `main` from Vercel (avoid feedback loop)

### Deploy-preview.yml Triggers

✅ **Runs on:**
- Create pull request to `main`
- Update existing PR to `main`

### Deployment-status.yml Triggers

✅ **Runs on:**
- Vercel deployment completes successfully

---

## Test Results Visibility

### GitHub Actions Tab
Go to: **Actions** tab on your repo

Shows:
- All workflow runs
- Test status (✅ pass or ❌ fail)
- Execution time
- Artifact downloads (Playwright reports)
- Coverage reports

### Pull Request Comments
Tests auto-post to PR:
- Test result summary
- Coverage changes
- Vercel preview URL
- Deployment status

### Vercel Dashboard
Shows:
- Build logs
- Deployment status
- Production status
- Independent from GitHub Actions

---

## Common Questions

### Q1: Will tests delay my deployments?
**A:** No. Vercel deploys simultaneously with tests. Vercel usually finishes BEFORE tests.

### Q2: What if tests fail but I still want to deploy?
**A:** You can - tests are feedback on main, not blockers. But PRs must have passing tests.

### Q3: Do I have to merge through PRs?
**A:** Not technically, but with branch protection rules, you should. Direct pushes to main are blocked.

### Q4: Can tests block production?
**A:** Only for PRs (branch protection). Tests don't prevent main deployments, only merges to main.

### Q5: What's the cost?
**A:** Free for public repos on GitHub/Vercel. Free tier Codecov for open source.

### Q6: How long do tests take?
- Unit & Integration: 3-4 minutes
- E2E: 5-7 minutes
- Build verification: 2-3 minutes
- **Total: ~10 minutes** (can run in parallel)

### Q7: What if E2E tests are flaky?
**A:** Re-run from GitHub Actions. Once test infrastructure is stable, flakiness decreases.

### Q8: How do I fix test failures?
**A:**
1. Check error in Actions log
2. Reproduce locally: `npm run test:run` or `npm run test:e2e`
3. Fix code
4. Push fix - tests auto-rerun
5. Once pass, PR is mergeable

## Branch Protection Rules ✅ (CONFIGURED & ACTIVE)

### Status: ACTIVE
Branch protection is now enforced on the `master` branch. All pull requests must:
1. ✅ Have passing tests (all status checks)
2. ✅ Have at least 1 approval
3. ✅ Have up-to-date branches before merge

### Required Status Checks (All Enforced)
- [x] Test Suite / Unit & Integration Tests (18.x)
- [x] Test Suite / Unit & Integration Tests (20.x)
- [x] Test Suite / E2E Tests (Playwright)
- [x] Test Suite / Build Verification
- [x] Test Suite / Test Results Summary

### How It Works

When you create a PR to `master`:

```
All status checks must pass before merge:
✅ All checks have passed (9 successful checks)
- Test Suite / Unit & Integration Tests (18.x) - ✅
- Test Suite / Unit & Integration Tests (20.x) - ✅
- Test Suite / E2E Tests (Playwright) - ✅
- Test Suite / Build Verification - ✅
- Test Suite / Test Results Summary - ✅
... (plus other checks)

[Merge pull request] button is enabled ONLY when all pass
```

### What Gets Blocked

Developers cannot:
- ❌ Merge to master without passing tests
- ❌ Push directly to master (must use PR)
- ❌ Merge stale branches without rebasing
- ❌ Merge without required approval

### How to Modify Branch Protection

If you need to adjust settings:
1. Go to: `https://github.com/reidperyam/gst-website/settings/branches`
2. Find the "master" rule
3. Click "Edit" to modify
4. Click "Delete rule" to remove (not recommended)

---

## Final Summary

You now have:

1. ✅ **Complete test strategy** - What to test, how to test it, coverage targets
2. ✅ **GitHub Actions workflows** - Automated testing on every push/PR (optimized & streamlined)
3. ✅ **552 passing tests (180 unit/integration, 372 E2E)** - Unit (68), Integration (32), E2E (150) across 3 browsers
