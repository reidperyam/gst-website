# Testing & CI/CD Documentation

Complete reference for testing setup and continuous integration on the GST Website project.

## 📚 Documentation

Start with one of these based on your needs:

- **[INDEX.md](./INDEX.md)** - Navigation guide with use-case shortcuts
- **[QUICK_REFERENCE.md](./QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - One-page cheat sheet for common tasks
- **[TEST_STRATEGY.md](./TEST_STRATEGY.md)** - Comprehensive testing approach and patterns
- **[GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md](./GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md)** - How to set up CI/CD pipeline
- **[BRANCH_PROTECTION_CONFIG.md](./BRANCH_PROTECTION_CONFIG.md)** - GitHub branch protection rules
- **[TEST_BEST_PRACTICES.md](./TEST_BEST_PRACTICES.md)** - E2E testing best practices and red flags

## Quick Facts

- **Total Tests**: 552 (all passing)
  - Unit/Integration: 180 tests (Vitest)
  - E2E: 372 tests (Playwright, cross-browser)
- **Test Frameworks**: Vitest + Playwright
- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions (test.yml)
- **Coverage Target**: 70%+ (currently exceeding)

## Common Commands

```bash
# Run tests locally
npm run test                   # Watch mode
npm run test:run              # Single run (unit/integration)
npm run test:e2e              # E2E tests only
npm run test:all              # Everything

# View results
npm run test:ui               # Vitest UI (unit/integration)
npm run test:e2e:ui           # Playwright UI (E2E)
npm run test:e2e:debug        # Playwright debug mode

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage         # With coverage metrics
```

## How It Works

1. **Local Development**: Run `npm run test:all` before pushing
2. **Push to GitHub**: Triggers `test.yml` workflow automatically
3. **GitHub Actions**: Runs full test suite (552 tests) on every push/PR
4. **Branch Protection**: Requires all tests to pass before merge
5. **Vercel Deployment**: Auto-deploys on successful merge to main
