### Schema Definition

```json
{
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Reid Peryam",
  "jobTitle": "Strategic Technology Advisor",
  "sameAs": [
    "https://www.linkedin.com/in/reidperyam/"
  ],

      "name": "UC Berkeley Haas School of Business"
    },
    {
      "@type": "CollegeOrUniversity",
      "name": "Boston University"
    }
  ],
  "hasCredential": [ /* Array of 18 credential objects */ ]
}
```

### Field Descriptions

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `@type` | String | Schema type (Person) |
| `name` | String | Full name of founder |
| `jobTitle` | String | Current professional title |
| `sameAs` | Array[URL] | Links to social profiles (LinkedIn, etc.) |
| `alumniOf` | Array[Organization] | Educational background |

### Authority Building

The Person schema contributes to authority through:

1. **Education Association**: Links to prestigious institutions (UC Berkeley, Boston University)
2. **Credential Count**: 18 documented certifications
3. **Credential Diversity**: Mix of technical, leadership, and executive education
4. **Recency**: Recent credentials (2023) show continued learning
5. **Expiration Tracking**: Shows maintained active certifications

## Credential Objects

### Credential Schema Structure

All credentials follow the `EducationalOccupationalCredential` schema:

```json
{
  "@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential",
  "name": "Credential Name",
  "credentialCategory": "Professional Certification" | "Executive Education",
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization" | "CollegeOrUniversity",
    "name": "Issuing Organization Name"
  },
  "datePublished": "YYYY-MM",
  "expires": "YYYY-MM",  // Optional: omit if non-expiring
  "identifier": "UNIQUE_CREDENTIAL_ID",
  "competencyRequired": "Skill 1, Skill 2, Skill 3"
}
```

### Field Descriptions (Schema.org Compliant)

| Field | Type | Purpose | Required |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| `@type` | String | Always "EducationalOccupationalCredential" | Yes |
| `name` | String | Full credential name | Yes |
| `credentialCategory` | String | Type of credential | Yes |
| `publisher` | Organization | Organization that issued the credential (from CreativeWork) | Yes |
| `datePublished` | Date | Issue date in YYYY-MM format (from CreativeWork) | Yes |
| `expires` | Date | Expiration date in YYYY-MM format (from CreativeWork) | No* |
| `identifier` | String | Credential ID for verification (from CreativeWork) | Yes |
| `competencyRequired` | String | Comma-separated skills string (specific to this type) | Recommended |

*`expires` is optional. Omit for non-expiring credentials (degrees, permanent certifications).

**⚠️ Property Name Changes**: These are the official Schema.org property names verified against the official documentation. Properties like `publisher`, `datePublished`, `expires`, and `identifier` are inherited from CreativeWork (the parent type). Previous versions used non-standard names (`issuedBy`, `offeredBy`, `dateIssued`, `dateExpires`, `validUntil`, `credentialId`, `skills` array) which caused validation errors.

## Hub Tools: WebApplication Schema

### Purpose

Describes each hub tool as a free, browser-based web application with author expertise signaling. Uses `WebApplication` (a subtype of `SoftwareApplication`) because these tools run entirely in the browser with no installation required.

### Why WebApplication over SoftwareApplication

`WebApplication` is a Schema.org subtype of `SoftwareApplication` specifically designed for browser-based applications. It inherits all `SoftwareApplication` properties and is more semantically precise for tools that:
- Run entirely in the browser (client-side processing)
- Require no download or installation
- Are accessed via URL

Google supports both types for rich results (price, ratings). `WebApplication` additionally supports `browserRequirements` if needed in the future.

### Schema Template

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebApplication",
  "name": "Tool Name",
  "description": "Brief description of the tool's purpose",
  "applicationCategory": "BusinessApplication",
  "operatingSystem": "Web",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "0",
    "priceCurrency": "USD"
  },
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Global Strategic Technologies"
  },
  "datePublished": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "dateModified": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "featureList": ["Feature 1", "Feature 2", "Feature 3"],
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Reid Peryam",
    "jobTitle": "Strategic Technology Advisor",
    "sameAs": ["https://www.linkedin.com/in/reidperyam/"],
    "description": "Technology advisor with experience across 100+ PE technology diligence engagements",
    "knowsAbout": ["Tool-Specific Expertise 1", "Tool-Specific Expertise 2"]
  }
}
```

### Field Descriptions

| Field | Type | Purpose | Required |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| `@type` | String | Always `WebApplication` for hub tools | Yes |
| `name` | String | Tool display name | Yes |

### Adding a New Tool

When creating a new hub tool:

1. Copy the WebApplication JSON-LD template into the tool's `index.astro`
2. Set tool-specific `name`, `description`, and `featureList`
3. Set `datePublished` to the launch date, `dateModified` to today
4. Customize the `knowsAbout` array for the tool's domain (keep 5 items, always include "Technical Due Diligence" and "M&A Tech Strategy")
5. Add the tool to the `ItemList` on the tools landing page
6. Update this document with the new tool's details
7. Validate with Google Structured Data Testing Tool

### Updating dateModified

Update `dateModified` on a tool's schema when:
- Question banks or scoring models are updated
- New features are added
- Significant UI/UX changes are made
- Do **not** update for minor bug fixes or style tweaks

## Hub Tools Landing: ItemList Schema

### Purpose

Describes the tools collection page as an ordered list of web applications, enabling potential list-style rich results in search.

### Schema Definition

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "ItemList",
  "name": "GST Strategic Intelligence Tools",
  "description": "Interactive calculators and generators to quantify risk and value in technology investments",
  "numberOfItems": 5,
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Regulatory Map",
      "url": "https://globalstrategic.tech/hub/tools/regulatory-map"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,
      "name": "The Diligence Machine",
      "url": "https://globalstrategic.tech/hub/tools/diligence-machine"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 3,
      "name": "Technical Debt Cost Calculator",
      "url": "https://globalstrategic.tech/hub/tools/tech-debt-calculator"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 4,
      "name": "Infrastructure Cost Governance",
      "url": "https://globalstrategic.tech/hub/tools/infrastructure-cost-governance"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 5,
      "name": "TechPar",
      "url": "https://globalstrategic.tech/hub/tools/techpar"
    }
  ]
}
```

### File Location

`src/pages/hub/tools/index.astro`

### Maintenance

When adding or removing tools from the landing page:
1. Update the `itemListElement` array (maintain position order)
2. Update `numberOfItems` to match the array length
3. Ensure each tool's `url` matches its actual route
4. Position order should match the visual order on the page

## BreadcrumbList Schema

### Purpose

Provides structured breadcrumb navigation data to search engines, enabling breadcrumb-style display in SERPs. Automatically generated from the page's URL pathname on all non-homepage pages.

### Schema Definition

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Home",
      "item": "https://globalstrategic.tech/"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,
      "name": "The GST Hub",
      "item": "https://globalstrategic.tech/hub/"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 3,
      "name": "The Workbench"
    }
  ]
}
```

### How It Works

- Automatically generated from `Astro.url.pathname` — no props needed
- Only rendered on non-homepage pages
- The last breadcrumb item omits the `item` URL (Google best practice for current page)
- Slug-to-name mapping is defined in `SEO.astro` for clean display names

### Slug-to-Name Mapping

| Slug | Display Name |
|------|-------------|
| `services` | Services |
| `about` | About |
| `ma-portfolio` | M&A Portfolio |
| `privacy` | Privacy Policy |
| `terms` | Terms of Service |
| `hub` | The GST Hub |
| `tools` | The Workbench |
| `diligence-machine` | Diligence Machine |
| `library` | The Library |
| `business-architectures` | Business Architectures |
| `vdr-structure` | VDR Structure |
| `radar` | The Radar |

Unmapped slugs are auto-formatted: hyphens replaced with spaces, words capitalized.

## FAQPage Schema

### Purpose

Enables FAQ rich results in Google SERPs when a page contains structured question/answer content. Currently active on the Services page and Regulatory Map.

### Schema Definition

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What's the difference between buy-side and sell-side diligence?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Buy-side diligence evaluates a target company..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Usage

Pass `faqItems` to the SEO component via `BaseLayout`:

```astro
<BaseLayout
  title="Services | GST"
  faqItems={[
    { question: "Your question?", answer: "Your answer." },
  ]}
>
```

The schema is only rendered when `faqItems` is provided and non-empty.

## Skills Association

### Purpose

Skills linked to credentials enable semantic understanding of expertise areas and support skill-based search queries.

### Skills Taxonomy

Current skills are associated with credentials as follows:

```
Cloud Architecture (5 credentials)
├── Azure Solutions Architect Expert
├── Azure DevOps Engineer Expert
├── Azure AI Engineer Associate
├── Digital Transformation
└── Cloud-Native Architecture (in knowsAbout)

AI/Machine Learning (7 credentials)
├── Azure AI Engineer Associate
├── Azure AI Fundamentals
├── Artificial Intelligence: Business Strategies
├── Machine Learning (multiple)
├── Certificate of Business Excellence
├── Business Analytics for Leaders
└── Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies

Leadership/Strategy (10 credentials)
├── Executive Leadership
├── Digital Transformation (2x)
├── Technology Strategy (5x)
├── Organizational Leadership (3x)
├── Product Management (5x)
├── Business Strategy (2x)
└── Enterprise Architecture (2x)

Development/Infrastructure (6 credentials)
├── Software Development (3x)
├── Kubernetes (2x)
├── DevOps (2x)
├── Azure DevOps (2x)
└── SDLC

Project Management (4 credentials)
├── Leading Complex Projects
├── Agile Methodologies
├── Agile Project Management
└── Scrum
```

### Adding Skills to New Credentials

When adding a new credential:

1. Choose 3-5 highly relevant skills
2. Use consistent skill naming (capitalize properly)
3. Prefer skills from existing taxonomy when possible
4. Map back to the "knowsAbout" array if it's a primary expertise area

Example:
```json
"competencyRequired": "Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, Cloud-Native Architecture"
```

### When to Update Schema

**Add Credentials When**:
- New certification is earned
- Executive education program is completed
- Professional designation changes
- Industry certifications are renewed

**Update Existing Credentials When**:
- Credential expires (update or remove `expires`)
- Skills associated with credential change
- Organization name changes
- Credential ID changes

**Update KnowsAbout When**:
- New primary expertise area is established
- Business focus shifts
- Service offerings expand

**Update Hub Tool Schemas When**:
- A new tool is launched (add WebApplication + update ItemList)
- A tool receives significant feature updates (update `dateModified`, `featureList`)
- A tool is retired (remove from ItemList, consider removing schema)

### How to Update Schema

#### Step 1: Edit the Appropriate File
- **Organization/Person**: `src/components/SEO.astro`
- **Hub Tools**: `src/pages/hub/tools/[tool-name]/index.astro`
- **Tools Landing**: `src/pages/hub/tools/index.astro`

#### Step 2: Validate
1. Run schema validator
2. Use Google Structured Data Testing Tool
3. Check for console errors

#### Step 3: Test
```bash
npm run test:all
```

#### Step 4: Update Documentation
Update this file (`src/docs/seo/JSON_LD_SCHEMA.md`) with any changes.

#### Step 5: Commit & Deploy
```bash
git add src/components/SEO.astro  # or relevant tool file
git commit -m "Update JSON-LD schema: [description of change]"
git push
```

### Deprecating Credentials

For expired certifications, you have two options:

**Option 1: Keep with expiration date**
```json
{
  "name": "Certified Kubernetes Administrator",
  "expires": "2024-01",
  // This transparently shows it has expired
}
```

**Option 2: Remove entirely**
- Delete the object from `hasCredential` array
- Update `CREDENTIALS_REFERENCE.md`

Recommendation: Keep important credentials even if expired (shows comprehensive training).
