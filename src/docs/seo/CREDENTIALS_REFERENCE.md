- A professional designation is obtained
- The credential is relevant to M&A advisory services

### How to Add

#### Step 1: Gather Information

Collect the following:
- [ ] Official credential name
- [ ] Issuing organization
- [ ] Issue date (YYYY-MM format)
- [ ] Expiration date (if applicable, YYYY-MM format)
- [ ] Credential ID or verification URL
- [ ] Associated skills (3-5 relevant skills)
- [ ] Category (Professional Certification or Executive Education)

#### Step 2: Format the Credential Object

```json
{
  "@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential",
  "name": "Exact Credential Name",
  "credentialCategory": "Professional Certification",
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Issuing Organization"
  },
  "datePublished": "2024-06",
  "expires": "2026-06",
  "identifier": "CREDENTIAL_ID_HERE",
  "competencyRequired": "Skill 1, Skill 2, Skill 3"
}
```

**Property Notes (Schema.org Compliant)**:
- Use `publisher` (not `issuedBy`) - Organization that issued the credential (inherited from CreativeWork)
- Use `datePublished` (not `dateIssued`) - issue date in YYYY-MM format (inherited from CreativeWork)

- Use `competencyRequired` (not `skills`) - comma-separated string of skills (specific to EducationalOccupationalCredential)

#### Step 3: Add to SEO Component

Location: `src/components/SEO.astro`

Find the `hasCredential` array and append your new credential:

```typescript
"hasCredential": [
  // ... existing credentials
  {
    "@type": "EducationalOccupationalCredential",
    "name": "Your New Credential",
    // ... rest of object
  }
]
```

#### Step 4: Update Documentation

Update this file (`CREDENTIALS_REFERENCE.md`) with:
- New credential summary
- Skills mapping (if applicable)
- Relevance to advisory services

#### Step 5: Validate

```bash
# Test the change
npm run test:all

# Validate JSON-LD
# Use Google Structured Data Testing Tool
# Paste your updated HTML and verify no errors
```

#### Step 6: Commit

```bash
git add src/components/SEO.astro src/docs/seo/CREDENTIALS_REFERENCE.md
git commit -m "Add credential: [Credential Name] from [Organization]"
git push
```
