  fintech: {
    label: 'Fintech',
    note: 'Fintech companies typically carry 10-20% higher infrastructure costs than pure SaaS due to compliance infrastructure, payment processing, and data security requirements. R&D ratios are comparable, but regulatory engineering and audit readiness can drive personnel costs above benchmark. Consider adjusting the healthy range upward by 5-10 percentage points when interpreting results.',

  marketplace: {
    label: 'Marketplace',
    note: 'Marketplace businesses often show lower technology-to-revenue ratios than SaaS because revenue recognition differs. Technology cost as a percentage of GMV is often a more relevant metric than technology cost as a percentage of net revenue. If you entered net revenue, your ratios may appear healthier than the underlying economics suggest. If you entered GMV, ratios will appear elevated relative to SaaS benchmarks.',

  infra_hw: {
    label: 'Infra / Hardware',
    note: 'Infrastructure and hardware-intensive companies carry cost structures that differ fundamentally from SaaS. Hardware COGS, manufacturing R&D, and embedded software development are not captured in these benchmarks. Software-only technology spend as a percentage of revenue is typically 5-15 percentage points lower than SaaS norms at the same stage. Use these results as a directional reference for the software layer only.',

The zone classifications and trajectory projections remain useful for identifying trends, even if the absolute thresholds require adjustment.',
