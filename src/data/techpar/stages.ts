    note: 'At seed stage, a high technology cost ratio is expected. Infrastructure often leads revenue. What matters is whether the ratio trends down as ARR scales.',

    note: 'Series A companies often carry cost structures from rapid early growth. The key question is whether technology spend as a percentage of revenue is declining as you scale.',
    noteUnder: 'Technology spend below 12% of ARR at Series A may signal underinvestment in engineering or infrastructure. Sustained underspend can impair product velocity and create technical debt that is costly to unwind later.',

    note: 'At Series B\u2013C, technology spend should be converging toward a sustainable ratio. Persistent overspend signals architectural issues that compound as you scale toward profitability.',
    noteUnder: 'Technology spend below 10% of ARR at Series B\u2013C is atypically lean. Verify that engineering capacity and infrastructure are sufficient to support your growth targets before attributing this to efficiency.',

    note: 'In a PE context, every percentage point above the 40% ceiling translates directly to EBITDA compression and exit value. Technology cost optimization is a financial engineering lever.',
    noteUnder: 'Technology spend below 8% of ARR in a PE-backed company warrants scrutiny. Underinvestment in infrastructure or engineering capacity can suppress growth and create execution risk at exit.',

    note: 'At enterprise scale, technology spend as a percentage of revenue is typically well below early-stage norms. Persistent spend above 32% warrants a structural review.',
    noteUnder: 'Technology spend below 6% of ARR at enterprise scale can indicate underinvestment in modernisation or maintenance. Legacy system risk and engineering capacity constraints often surface as operational drag over time.',
