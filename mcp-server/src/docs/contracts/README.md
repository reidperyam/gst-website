# Tool Input Contracts — Registry

This directory is the **registry index** for the per-tool input contracts that document every MCP tool exposed by the `@gst/mcp-server` workspace.

The per-tool contracts themselves live alongside their domain in sibling directories — e.g. `../diligence/CONTRACT.md` for the diligence machine, future `../techpar/CONTRACT.md` for TechPar, etc. This registry doc tracks them all, defines the pattern, and explains why input contracts are their own first-class artifact.

## What an input contract is

A versioned, human-readable description of the structured input that an MCP tool accepts. Every contract has three layers, each citing a canonical source that already exists in the codebase:

| Layer                  | What it documents                                                                                                                                                      | Canonical source                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Validation surface** | Field set, required vs optional, multi-select vs single-select, valid enum values                                                                                      | `src/schemas/<tool>.ts` (Zod schema)                                      |
| **User-facing labels** | Human-readable label, subtitle, per-option description                                                                                                                 | `src/data/<tool>/wizard-config.ts` (or equivalent)                        |
| **Downstream effects** | 1–3 line summary per field describing what categories of output the input gates; hidden-semantics callouts (multi-select auto-syncs, ordinal bracket comparison, etc.) | New content authored in the contract — the only layer not already in code |

Together these three answer "what can I send and what does it do?" without forcing the reader to read three TypeScript files.

A contract is NOT a copy of the Zod schema or the wizard-config — it cites them. Its job is consolidation plus the downstream-effect narrative that does not exist anywhere else.

---

## Why the contract is its own artifact

- **Self-service tool invocation.** A team member composing a prompt for an analyst doesn't need to grep `src/schemas/` to know what enum values are valid; the contract lists them with descriptions and downstream-effect notes.
- **AI-agent introspection.** An agent in a long-running conversation can fetch the contract for a tool, plan its inputs deliberately, and avoid wasted invocations against invalid enum values.
- **Onboarding.** New analysts get a "why each input matters" narrative — not just a list of valid values.
- **Drift surveillance at PR review.** A contract version bump makes schema changes visible at PR review time; aligns with the schema-reuse risk mitigation [BL-031.5](../../../../src/docs/development/MCP_SERVER_HUB_SURFACE_BL-031_5.md) calls out.
- **Foundation for prompt argsSchema reuse.** [BL-031.75](../../../../src/docs/development/MCP_SERVER_PROMPTS_BL-031_75.md) prompts compose `argsSchema` from tool input schemas; the contract gives that composition a stable, versioned reference.
- **Foundation for the IRL generator** (see below).

## The contracts registry

| Tool                 | MCP tool name                                  | Contract doc                                                     | Status                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Diligence Machine    | `generate_diligence_agenda`                    | [`../diligence/CONTRACT.md`](../diligence/CONTRACT.md)           | ✅ Authored (BL-031.85) |
| ICG                  | `assess_infrastructure_cost_governance`        | [`../icg/CONTRACT.md`](../icg/CONTRACT.md)                       | ✅ Authored (BL-031.5)  |
| TechPar              | `compute_techpar`                              | [`../techpar/CONTRACT.md`](../techpar/CONTRACT.md)               | ✅ Authored (BL-031.5)  |
| Tech Debt Calculator | `estimate_tech_debt_cost`                      | [`../tech-debt/CONTRACT.md`](../tech-debt/CONTRACT.md)           | ✅ Authored (BL-031.5)  |
| Regulatory Map       | `search_regulations`, `list_regulation_facets` | [`../regulatory-map/CONTRACT.md`](../regulatory-map/CONTRACT.md) | ✅ Authored (BL-031.5)  |
| Portfolio Search     | `search_portfolio`, `list_portfolio_facets`    | (planned: `../portfolio/CONTRACT.md`)                            | ⏳ Backlog              |
| Radar (cached)       | `search_radar_cache`                           | (planned alongside live `search_radar` in BL-032)                | ⏳ BL-032               |

Contract docs are authored alongside their MCP tool wrappers. The diligence contract is the inaugural reference implementation — see `../diligence/CONTRACT.md` for the template. The four BL-031.5 contracts (ICG, TechPar, Tech Debt, Regulatory Map) follow it. The Portfolio Search contract is deferred to its own follow-up, and Radar's contract is deferred to BL-032 (when the live `search_radar` tool ships and the contract can cover both the live and snapshot variants in one place).

---

## Per-tool contract spec template

Every per-tool `CONTRACT.md` follows this structure (the diligence-machine version is the reference implementation):

1. **Header** — tool name, one-line summary, source-of-truth pointers (Zod schema file, wizard-config file, engine file with line-range citations)
2. **Field overview table** — one row per input field with `field` / `type` / `multi or single` / `dimension label`. Dimension labels come from the engine's `CONDITION_LABELS` map (canonical at runtime) so the contract and trigger-map output stay aligned by construction
3. **Per-field detail sections** — one section per field, each with the field identifier, display label, subtitle, valid-values table (id / label / description), 1–3 line downstream-effect summary, cardinality / hidden-semantics callout where relevant
4. **Versioning header** — `version`, `lastAuthored` date, schema-source line range
5. **Related** — cross-references to the sibling `USAGE.md` walkthrough (if present), this registry, and the BL-031 architecture doc

---

## Versioning discipline

Each contract carries a `version` (semver-style integer or `vN`) and a `lastAuthored` date. The discipline:

- **Initial version**: `v1`, dated to authoring day
- **Bump triggers**: any change to enum values (added / removed / renamed); any change to the field set (new required field, removed field); any change to multi-select / ordinal semantics
- **Non-bump changes**: typo fixes in descriptions, expanded prose in downstream-effect summaries, restructured tables — version stays, `lastAuthored` updates
- **Cross-doc impact**: a contract version bump should trigger a review of dependent prompts (BL-031.75 prompts that compose `argsSchema` from the contract). Convention, not CI-enforced today

Pattern borrowed from the prompt-versioning approach in [MCP_SERVER_PROMPTS_BL-031_75.md](../../../../src/docs/development/MCP_SERVER_PROMPTS_BL-031_75.md). When BL-031.5 ships its four other Hub-tool contracts, each gets its own `v1` and its own version cadence.

---

## The IRL generator forward-look (out of scope today)

An **Information Request List** (IRL) is the strategic destination, not part of BL-031.85. Sketch:

A small downstream tool reads a contract (or a set of contracts) and emits a structured fill-in-the-blanks form — JSON, YAML, HTML, or a native MCP Resource depending on the consumer. The form is populated **offline** by an analyst or external AI agent that does not have direct access to the GST MCP server. The completed form is submitted to the appropriate MCP tool (or batched across tools).

Use case: a prospect's analyst preparing for a diligence engagement could fill in the deal profile in advance; the kickoff call starts with "here's the agenda" instead of "here are the 13 questions we need to ask."

What the contracts make possible: the IRL renderer has a stable, versioned input — every field's valid values, descriptions, and required/optional status — and can produce the form mechanically. Without the contracts, IRL would have to scrape the wizard-config or read Zod schemas directly; with them, IRL becomes a small focused tool.

What is explicitly out of scope for BL-031.85: the IRL generator itself, the rendering format, the offline-submission mechanism, the UI. Tracked separately if and when warranted.

## How to add a new per-tool contract

When BL-031.5 (or any future initiative) ships a new MCP tool:

1. Create a sibling directory `mcp-server/src/docs/<tool>/` if one does not exist
2. Author `mcp-server/src/docs/<tool>/CONTRACT.md` following the [per-tool spec template](#per-tool-contract-spec-template). The reference implementation at `../diligence/CONTRACT.md` is your guide
3. Update this registry's table — change the tool's status row from `⏳ BL-031.5` to `✅ Authored (<initiative-id>)` and replace the `(planned: ...)` placeholder with the actual relative link
4. Add a one-line top-of-file comment to the tool's Zod schema in `src/schemas/<tool>.ts` pointing to the contract (matches the diligence pattern)
5. Link the contract from `mcp-server/README.md` "What's exposed" table's `Input` column for that tool

That's the entire ceremony. No new files invented, no new conventions; the pattern is reusable and additive.
